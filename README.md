# Notes For Web Developers

My personal collection of notes about Web Development.

Examples: JavaScript: [Objects](Languages/JavaScript%20Core/2.%20Objects.md), [Functions](Languages/JavaScript%20Core/3.%20Functions.md), CSS: [Flex Layout](Languages/CSS/10.%20Flex%20Layout.md), [Grid Layout](Languages/CSS/11.%20Grid%20Layout.md).



## Introduction

The goal is to cover a topic as precisely and concisely as possible, include only the most current point of view, and give a hollistic understanding.

Please note, that these notes are, by matter of their selection, subjective. They aren't meant to cover anything, but cover what I want to learn. I select what I learn or likewise don't learn. For example, for authentication standards there are notes about OAuth but not the SAML because it's more up-to-date, for client-side Web framework there are notes about Svelte but not React because it's more declarative, modern, and intuitive.

This is a constant work in progress. Maybe I'll put the notes up on a web page some day to make them easier to browse. Until then, they are available as markdown files in the respective directories. The most complete are on JavaScript, TypeScript and CSS in the [Languages](Languages/) directory.
