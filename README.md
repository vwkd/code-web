# Notes For Web Developers

[TOC]



## Introduction

These notes comprise the things I learned while studying web development. Maybe they are useful to others as well.

This is a constant work in progress. Maybe I'll put the notes up on a web page some day to make them easier to browse. Until then, they are available as markdown files in the respective directories.

The most thorough notes are on JavaScript and TypeScript in the [Languages](Languages/) directory, for example [Objects](Languages/JavaScript%20Core/2.%20Objects.md) and [Functions](Languages/JavaScript%20Core/3.%20Functions.md).
