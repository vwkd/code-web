# Positioned Layout

[TOC]

<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction

- an irregular layout, "on top of" any regular layout

controlled by `position` property of element

different layout than others, takes boxes out of flow ??
can be used "on top of" all other layouts
need to manage the possibility of content overlapping


--> position absolutely irrespectively of surrounding content

if the box is absolutely positioned (via position) it's taken out-of-flow

position with respect to a containing block

-> can't use positioning properties top, bottom, left, and right on elements in normal flow, i.e. must have position: relative, absolute, fixed

Static: The default value places the item in the normal flow
Relative: The item is placed in the normal flow, and then shifted or offset from that position. Subsequent flow items are laid out as if the item had not been moved.
Absolute: Specifies absolute positioning. The element is positioned in relation to its nearest non-static ancestor.
Fixed: The item is absolutely positioned in a fixed position on the screen even as the rest of the document is scrolled


## Containing block

??for in-flow-elements is nearest block-level ancestor
??for out-of-flow elements is nearest positioned ancestor
??viewport if there is no containing block

??only important for Positioned Layout

- rectangle with respect to which a box is sized and laid out / positioned
- derived from dimensions of a box, except for initial containing block ???

??? - principal box that establishes the current formatting context

- beware: a box is not confined by its containing block, can overflow ❗️
- initial containing block: containing block of the root element
has size of viewport except affected by scrollbars

<!-- ToDo: move to layout
e.g. inline box’s containing block is the content box of its closest block container ancestor; ?? OLD FLOW TERMINOLOGY

if that block container is an in-flow block, then its containing block is formed by its parent block container;

if that grandparent block container is absolutely positioned, then its containing block is the padding edges of its closest positioned ancestor (not necessarily its parent)

and so on up to the initial containing block.


e.g. inline box’s containing block is the content box of its closest block container ancestor  ?? OLD FLOW TERMINOLOGY
absolutely positioned boxes containing block is the padding edges of its closest positioned ancestor
 -->

- beware: don't confuse content of box with boxes that have it as containing block, descendant boxes in box tree seem like content of box, but content can't overflow its box while a box can overflow its containing block

- beware: "a box's containing block" means the containing block of the box, not the one it establishes ❗️


<!-- from old layout -->
- box respective to which position and size of a descendant box is calculated
- beware: descendant box is positioned with respect to its containing block, but it is not confined by this containing block, it may overflow ❗️
- usually the parent element's box, e.g. ul of li, but not necessarily ????????


##

absolutely positioned elements establish new block formatting contexts for their contents
Absolute positioning or floating an element blockifies the box’s display type.
making a box out-of-flow causes it to blockify as well as to establish an independent formatting context

blockifies element, i.e. makes ODT block, irrelevant since out-of-flow ??, but allows size properties, but default is `max-content`

## Relative

stays in flow, but can push around
other elements interact with it as if it were at original position, "don't know it has been moved"

beware: above float in stacking context, i.e. background obscures float, hover on float doesn't work, etc.
see Google "relative position float stacking", https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43214089/unexplained-stacking-of-css-float-and-positionrelative, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40473051/why-does-a-relative-positioned-element-appear-above-a-floated-element
??can fix by giving float also relative position and a higher z-index

```html
<h1>Stacking order for relative position and float</h1>
<p>Note: Make sure to view on screen width with at least 600px to view the effect.</p>
<div class="float">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</div>
<div>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</div>
<div class="relative">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</div>
```

```css
div {
  background: lightgrey;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}

.float {
  float: right;
  background: tomato;
  width: 200px;
}

.relative {
  position: relative
}
```

relatively positioned elements serve as the containing block for positioned descendants !!!
still remains in flow, position can change depending on viewport width, can flow to next line, etc.
often makes parent position: relative without offsetting at all, just so that children can be absolutely positioned

## Absolute / Fixed

offsets are based on the containing block

later boxes move up in it's space, as if weren't there at all
move up in it's space, absolutely positioned box overlaps them,

parent box doesn't contain box anymore, as if it weren't there, no interaction whatsoever

removes box from "flow", and any space that it would have taken up is removed, as if weren't in box tree, other elements can't interact with it, as if weren't there !!!
absolutely positioned elements are removed from the flow of elements on the page, they don't affect each other at all, as if it was not there

fixed: offsets are based on the viewport rather than the containing block

applies to principal box

Absolute positioning: An absolutely positioned item has no place in, and no effect on, the normal flow of other items. It occupies its assigned position in its container independently of other items., can be fixed to point on page or on screen
Absolutely positioned element: `absolute` or `fixed`

## Fixed

offsets are based on the viewport rather than the containing block
