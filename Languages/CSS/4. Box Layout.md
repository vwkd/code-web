# Box Layout

[TOC]



## Introduction

- arrangement of boxes
- multiple layout models, e.g. flow layout, flex layout, grid layout, table layout
- applied within a formatting context, see Formatting Context
- controlled by `display` property of element and helper properties, e.g. `float`, `flex-flow`, etc.
- also positioned layout "on top of" other layouts
- controlled by `position` property of element
- beware: elements have no inherent layout, all set by user agent style sheet, e.g. `p { display: block; }`, `table { display: table; }`, `li { display: list-item; }`, etc.



## Formatting context

<!-- ToDo: assumptions broken by float ? -->

- a box layout applied to a specific set of boxes
- can think of a layout "instance" applied to specific boxes
- each box establishes a formatting context for its child descendant boxes

only exception is flow FC, where block-level box inside inline-level box can break out and follow another flow FC higher up in the flow FC chain, see Flow Layout


??? or continues the formatting context of its containing block
<!-- ToDo: define "continue FC", e.g. for IFC in IFC -->

- can think of region the formatting context is applied as the establishing box itself
but not actual region, since FCs can "overlap", use "layout applied to set of boxes"

- beware: some boxes may be in region that don't follow formatting context, "out-of-flow" boxes, e.g. absolutely positioned box
- nesting similar to nesting of boxes, nested FC is applied in the boundaries of parent FC, formatting context chain

![nested formatting contexts](illustrations/fc.svg)


- nested boxes are handled by nested FC, i.e. a FC only "knows" about immediate children

--> element's ODT  
--> FC of CB! WHAT IS CB???

- nested FCs don't affect each other, except through size of the establishing box, "independent"
(((except exclusions can are able to affect content across independent formatting context boundaries)))
except when box creates more than one FCs, these can be dependent

<!-- ToDo: define "in/dependent FC", e.g. for margins of BFC in BFC without root -->

- ???each box establishes a single FC

??? 0: continue existing

??? 1: exactly one
beware: don't confuse a FC which extends another FC as multiple, is just a superset in functionality, still logically different FC

??? 1+: multiple, co-existing, dependent
apply to same set of boxes at same time
e.g. inline formatting context within a block formatting context, see Flow Layout
<!-- ToDo: update terminology -->
![nested formatting contexts with multiple](illustrations/fcmixed.svg)

- ??? type of FC established by box may depend on ODT of child boxes it contains, e.g. block container ???


margins don't collapse accross formatting context boundaries ??? ONLY INDEPENDENT ???
anyways happens only for block FC ?!?!



## Terminology

### Out-of-flow box

- box laid out differently from formatting context it belongs to
- not at expected position in layout
- not in expected interaction with surrounding boxes
- "not part of normal flow of content in formatting context"

This occurs if the box is floated (via float) or absolutely positioned (via position)
i.e. box is floated or absolutely positioned
position is changed by something other than `display`, i.e. `position` or `float`
and root element (`<html>`)

OOF boxes create a new BFC ??!!

### In-flow box

- box that is not out-of-flow, i.e. laid out using formatting context it's in



## Box generation

- for each element one or more boxes (*) are created in box tree
- box tree hierarchy stays the same as document tree hierarchy ❗
- one box is the principal box, additional helper boxes may be created, usually only one additional ???
- boxes can be nested or at same depth ??? usually only nested with outer being the principal box???
- principal box contains boxes of descendant elements
- anonymous boxes that don't belong to any element may be created in addition to box(es) created by element
- (*) zero boxes may be created, see `display: none` or `display: contents`

### Principal box

- main box of element
- contains generated??? content of element
- contains boxes of descendant elements
- is applied style of element, see Helper box for exceptions

(((Certain properties can force a principal box to establish a new (independent) formatting context, e.g. making a box out-of-flow, or Turning a block (???) into a scroll container )))
Turning a block into a scroll container will cause it to establish an independent formatting context

### Helper box

- additional box of element
- generated for some display types of the element
- placed with respect to the principal box
e.g. `display: list-item` generates an additional marker box within the principal box, `display: table` generates an additional table grid box within the principal wrapper table box
- inherits style from principal box through box tree
- some non-inherited properties are applied to helper box instead of principal box, e.g. border properties applied to `display: table` element are applied to its helper table grid box instead of its principal wrapper table box

### Anonymous box

- box that is not associated with an element
- fixes up box tree when a particular nested structure is required that is not provided by the boxes generated from the element tree, e.g. a table cell box generates an anonymous table row box around itself if its parent box is not a table row box
- inherits style from box tree parentage, since has no associated element



## Layout

- layout of boxes starts from root of box tree downwards to tips by establishing formatting contexts
??? type of FC may depend on parent FC and/or child ODTs, e.g. block container

- positioning then relative to establishing box of FC, from tips upwards to root

beware: positioning and floats can affect layout, but don't affect box tree !!!



## Display type

- specifies type(s) of box(es) generated for element
- beware: user agent style sheet may set any value, overrides initial value ❗️
(((more values not covered here)))

### Box generation specific

- `display: none`: no boxes are generated for element and descendant
- as if element hadn't been in the document tree
- beware: only affects box tree but not document tree, i.e. selectors, property inheritance, event handling, etc. are not affected ❗️
- `display: contents`: no boxes are generated for element, but are generated for descendant elements
- as if element had been replaced in the document tree by its descendants
- beware: `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements are treated like descendant elements, `::before` is first child, `::after` is last child
- beware: only affects box tree but not document tree, i.e. selectors, property inheritance, event handling, etc. are not affected ❗️

### Layout specific

- `display: <display-outside> || <display-inside>`
- can be in any order, if only one is specified the others default depends on specified value ???
- initial value is `inline`, i.e. `inline flow`
- beware: layout-specific display type only affects visual layout, doesn't change semantics of element ❗️

#### Outer display type (ODT)

- type of ancestor FC the prinipal box follows / participates in
- ??? is always the closes ancestor FC of that type
- only used for FCs of Flow Layout, i.e. block and inline FCs, see Flow Layout

| ODT | PB | notes |
| - | - | - |
| `block` | block-level | default, for inner display types except `ruby` |
| `inline` | inline-level | default, for inner display type `ruby` |

#### Inner display type (IDT)

type of FC the box(es) establish(es) for children
unfortunately `flow`(`-root`) can mean either inline or block FC

may mean different things depending on FC it's in, or what ODT it has

PB is given a name, that characterises IDT, may depend on ODT and outside FC, but for children matters only the type of FC it establishes

- type of boxes generated
- type of formatting context established by boxes
- `flow` is default, for any outer display type

| IDT | if ODT | if parent FC | FC established | notes |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| `flow` | not `block` | inline or block | IFC | i.e. PB is inline box |
| `flow` | `block` | x | BFC or IFC ??? | i.e. PB is block container box |
| `flow` | x | not (inline or block) | BFC | i.e. PB is block container box |


| IDT | PB | PB FC | HB | HB FC | notes |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| `flow` | block box or inline box | ?? | - | - | depending on ODT and children ODT ?? |
| `flow-root` | block box | new block FC | - | - | - |
| `flex` | flex container box | new flex FC | - | - | - |
| `grid` | grid container box | new grid FC | - | - | - |
| `ruby` | ruby container box | new ruby FC | - | - | if ODT `inline` |
| `ruby` | wrapper box of appropriate ODT | new inline FC | ruby container box | new ruby FC | otherwise |
| `table` | wrapper table box | new block FC | table grid box | new table FC | - |


| IDT | PB | PB FC | HB | HB FC | notes |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| `flow` | inline box | continues same inline FC | - | - | if ODT not `block` AND parent formatting context block / inline |
| `flow` | block box | ?? | - | - | otherwise |

### Lists

- can append `list-item` to `display: ODT IDT`
- generates additional `::marker` pseudo-element
- content of `::marker` is specified by list-style properties
see CSS2 12.5
beware: often set on parent element so that inherits to children elements with `list-item`, e.g. on `<ul>`, `<ol>` to inherit to `<li>`
- beware: user agent style sheet sets `<li>` to `display: list-item`

### Defaulting

- if leaves out one DT the other DT(s) default(s)

specifies both inner and outer display type

| shorthand | longhand | notes |
| - | - | - |
| `block` | `block flow` | since IDT defaults to `flow` |
| `flow-root` | `block flow-root` | since ODT defaults to `block` |
| `inline` | `inline flow` | since IDT defaults to `flow` |
| `flex` | `block flex` | since ODT defaults to `block` |
| `grid` | `block grid` | since ODT defaults to `block` |
| `table` | `block table` | since ODT defaults to `block` |
| `ruby` | `inline ruby` | since ODT defaults to `inline` ❗️|
| `list-item` | `block flow list-item` | since ODT defaults to `block` and IDT to `flow` |
| `inline list-item` | `inline flow list-item` | since IDT defaults to `flow` |

### Single-keyword syntax

- shorthand value for ODT `inline`
- legacy, don't use anymore ❗️

| shorthand | longhand |
| - | - |
| `inline-block` | `inline flow-root` |
| `inline-flex` | `inline flex` |
| `inline-grid` | `inline grid` |
| `inline-table` | `inline table` |
