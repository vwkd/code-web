# Box generation

[TOC]



## Introduction

- for each element one or more boxes (*) are created in box tree
- box tree hierarchy stays the same as document tree hierarchy ❗
- one box is the principal box, additional helper boxes may be created, usually only one additional ???
- boxes can be nested or at same depth ??? usually only nested with outer being the principal box???
- principal box contains boxes of descendant elements
- anonymous boxes that don't belong to any element may be created in addition to box(es) created by element
- (*) zero boxes may be created, see `display: none` or `display: contents`

### Principal box

- main box of element
- contains generated??? content of element
- contains boxes of descendant elements
- is applied style of element, see Helper box for exceptions

(((Certain properties can force a principal box to establish a new (independent) formatting context, e.g. making a box out-of-flow, or Turning a block (???) into a scroll container )))
Turning a block into a scroll container will cause it to establish an independent formatting context

### Helper box

- additional box of element
- generated for some display types of the element
- placed with respect to the principal box
e.g. `display: list-item` generates an additional marker box within the principal box, `display: table` generates an additional table grid box within the principal wrapper table box
- inherits style from principal box through box tree
- some non-inherited properties are applied to helper box instead of principal box, e.g. border properties applied to `display: table` element are applied to its helper table grid box instead of its principal wrapper table box

### Anonymous box

- box that is not associated with an element
- fixes up box tree when a particular nested structure is required that is not provided by the boxes generated from the element tree, e.g. a table cell box generates an anonymous table row box around itself if its parent box is not a table row box
- inherits style from box tree parentage, since has no associated element



## Layout

- layout of boxes starts from root of box tree downwards to tips by establishing formatting contexts
??? type of FC may depend on parent FC and/or child ODTs, e.g. block container

- [...]-level box: box that participates in a [...] formatting context, e.g. block-level box, inline-level box, flex-level box, etc.
beware: "block-level" is again short for "block-inline-level" ❗️

- positioning then relative to establishing box of FC, from tips upwards to root

beware: positioning and floats can affect layout, but don't affect box tree !!!



## Display type

- specifies type(s) of box(es) generated for element
- beware: user agent style sheet may set any value, overrides initial value ❗️
(((more values not covered here)))

### Box generation specific

- `display: none`: no boxes are generated for element and descendant
- as if element hadn't been in the document tree
- beware: only affects box tree but not document tree, i.e. selectors, property inheritance, event handling, etc. are not affected ❗️
- `display: contents`: no boxes are generated for element, but are generated for descendant elements
- as if element had been replaced in the document tree by its descendants
- beware: `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements are treated like descendant elements, `::before` is first child, `::after` is last child
- beware: only affects box tree but not document tree, i.e. selectors, property inheritance, event handling, etc. are not affected ❗️

### Layout specific

- `display: <display-outside> || <display-inside>`
- can be in any order, if only one is specified the others default depends on specified value ???
- initial value is `inline`, i.e. `inline flow`
- beware: layout-specific display type only affects visual layout, doesn't change semantics of element ❗️

#### Outer display type (ODT)

- type of ancestor FC the prinipal box follows / participates in
- ??? is always the closes ancestor FC of that type
- only used for FCs of Flow Layout, i.e. block-inline and inline FCs, see Flow Layout

| ODT | PB | notes |
| - | - | - |
| `block` | block-level | default, for inner display types except `ruby` |
| `inline` | inline-level | default, for inner display type `ruby` |

#### Inner display type (IDT)

type of FC the box(es) establish(es) for children
unfortunately `flow` can mean either inline or block-inline

may mean different things depending on FC it's in, or what ODT it has

PB is given a name, that characterises IDT, may depend on ODT and outside FC, but for children matters only the type of FC it establishes

- type of boxes generated
- type of formatting context established by boxes
- `flow` is default, for any outer display type

| IDT | if ODT | if parent FC | FC established | notes |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| `flow` | not `block` | inline or block-inline | IFC | i.e. PB is inline box |
| `flow` | `block` | x | BFC or IFC ??? | i.e. PB is block container box |
| `flow` | x | not (inline or block-inline) | BFC | i.e. PB is block container box |


| IDT | PB | PB FC | HB | HB FC | notes |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| `flow` | block box or inline box | ?? | - | - | depending on ODT and children ODT ?? |
| `flow-root` | block box | new block FC | - | - | - |
| `flex` | flex container box | new flex FC | - | - | - |
| `grid` | grid container box | new grid FC | - | - | - |
| `ruby` | ruby container box | new ruby FC | - | - | if ODT `inline` |
| `ruby` | wrapper box of appropriate ODT | new inline FC | ruby container box | new ruby FC | otherwise |
| `table` | wrapper table box | new block FC | table grid box | new table FC | - |


| IDT | PB | PB FC | HB | HB FC | notes |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| `flow` | inline box | continues same inline FC | - | - | if ODT not `block` AND parent formatting context block / inline |
| `flow` | block box | ?? | - | - | otherwise |

### Lists

- can append `list-item` to `display: ODT IDT`
- generates additional `::marker` pseudo-element
- content of `::marker` is specified by list-style properties
see CSS2 12.5

### Defaulting

- if leaves out one DT the other DT(s) default(s)

specifies both inner and outer display type

| shorthand | longhand | notes |
| - | - | - |
| `block` | `block flow` | since IDT defaults to `flow` |
| `flow-root` | `block flow-root` | since ODT defaults to `block` |
| `inline` | `inline flow` | since IDT defaults to `flow` |
| `flex` | `block flex` | since ODT defaults to `block` |
| `grid` | `block grid` | since ODT defaults to `block` |
| `table` | `block table` | since ODT defaults to `block` |
| `ruby` | `inline ruby` | since ODT defaults to `inline` ❗️|
| `list-item` | `block flow list-item` | since ODT defaults to `block` and IDT to `flow` |
| `inline list-item` | `inline flow list-item` | since IDT defaults to `flow` |

### Single-keyword syntax

- shorthand value for ODT `inline`
- legacy, don't use anymore ❗️

| shorthand | longhand |
| - | - |
| `inline-block` | `inline flow-root` |
| `inline-flex` | `inline flex` |
| `inline-grid` | `inline grid` |
| `inline-table` | `inline table` |
