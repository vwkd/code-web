## Alignment

position of the box within its parent, or the box’s content within itself.

...

beware: “justify” and “align” to distinguish between alignment in the inline axis and block axis, arbitrary definition
i.e. justify- aligns columns, align- aligns rows
arbitrary “justify” and “align” to distinguish between alignment in the main/inline and cross/block dimensions

<!-- todo: baseline, see 4.2, 5.4, 9, css-align -->
<!-- todo: overflow, see 5.3, css-overflow -->

### Content distribution

position of element's content within its own content box
i.e. effectively adjusts padding of element

alignment subject and alignment container both assume the writing mode of the box the *-content property is set on ??? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN

space-between: default fallback alignment for this value is start
space-around, space-evenly: default fallback alignment for this value is center
stretch:
any auto-sized alignment subjects have their size increased equally (not proportionally) to fill the alignment container
still respecting the constraints imposed by max-height/max-width (or equivalent functionality)
default fallback alignment for this value is start

#### align-content

aligns grid rows ??? within content box of element
normal |  stretch, space-between, space-around, space-evenly | center, start, end
initial value: normal, behaves as stretch
applies to grid containers
not inherited

direction according to writing mode in that element ?? OR MEANDS WRITING DIRECTION

#### justify-content

aligns grid columns ??? within content box of element
Value: normal | stretch, space-between, space-around, space-evenly | center, start, end
initial value: normal, behaves as stretch
applies to grid containers
not inherited

direction according to writing mode in that element ?? OR MEANDS WRITING DIRECTION

#### place-content

shorthand for both
Value: <'align-content'> <'justify-content'>?
Initial: normal
Applies to grid containers
Inherited: no
if second is ommitted it's copied from the first value



### Self-alignment

position of margin box of element within parent
aligns margin box of grid items within columns/rows
i.e. effectively adjusts margins of elements

#### justify-self

Value: auto | normal | stretch | center, start, end, self-start, self-end
Initial: auto
Applies to grid items
Inherited: no

auto behaves as the computed justify-items value of the parent box

normal behaves as stretch for items with no intrinsic aspect ratio, and start for items with an intrinsic aspect ratio: see Grid Item Sizing in [CSS-GRID-1]. The resulting box is start-aligned.

stretch: 
When the box’s computed width/height (as appropriate to the axis) is auto and neither of its margins (in the appropriate axis) are auto, sets the box’s used size to the length necessary to make its outer size as close to filling the alignment container as possible while still respecting the constraints imposed by min-height/min-width/max-height/max-width.
Unless otherwise specified, this value falls back to flex-start
Note: The stretch keyword can cause elements to shrink, to fit their container.

#### align-self

Value: auto | normal | stretch | center, start, end, self-start, self-end
Initial: auto
Applies to grid items
Inherited: no

LIKE JUSTIFY-SELF

#### place-self

shorthand for align-self and justify-self

Value: <'align-self'> <'justify-self'>?
Initial: auto
Applies to grid items
Inherited: no

if second value is omitted, it is copied from the first value



### Default alignment

set the default align-self and justify-self behavior of the element’s child boxes I.E. THOSE WITH `auto`
shorthand to set all child items with *-self: auto
specify the interpretation of any *-self: auto used on children of the container

applies to grid containers

direction according to writing mode in that element ?? OR MEANDS WRITING DIRECTION

beware: The *-items properties don’t affect the element itself
specify the interpretation of any *-self: auto used on children of the container element.
