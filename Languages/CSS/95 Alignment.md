[TOC]


<!-- ToDo: finish, integrate text from Flex Layout -->

position of the box within its parent, or the box’s content within itself.


arbitrary “justify” and “align” to distinguish between alignment in the main/inline and cross/block dimensions


The *-items properties don’t affect the element itself. When set on a container, they specify the interpretation of any *-self: auto used on children of the container element.
