# Units
<!-- Values and Units -->

[TOC]

<!-- ToDo: finish, see css-units-->


## Introduction

- most values are of a specific type, need units
keywords, data types
set of valid values for property

value types:
keyword values
basic data types

All CSS properties also accept the CSS-wide keyword values as the sole component of their property value
CSS-wide keywords: initial, inherit and unset

values may occur in combination


## Textual Types

### Keywords

- pre-defined keywords and author-defined identifiers
e.g. `auto`, `start`, `end`, all CSS-wide keywords, etc.
- unquoted strings
- case insensitive

### String

- quoted strings
- double quotes or single quotes
- case sensitive
- need to escape quotes in content using `\` if same as delimiters

### URL

- `url( <string> <url-modifier>* )`
- beware: base URL in external style sheet is URL of style sheet itself, not of document that uses style sheet



## Numeric Types

<integer>, <number>, <percentage>, and various dimensions including <length>, <angle>, <time>, <frequency>, and <resolution>.

### Integer

- $+$/$-d_i \ldots d_0$ with $d_i \in \{0,1,\ldots,9\}$, e.g. `117`
- leading zeros of multi-digit integer part is ignored, e.g. `02` is `2`

### Number

- $+$/$-d_i \ldots d_0.d_i \ldots d_0E$/$e+$/$-d_i \ldots d_0$ with $d_i \in \{0,1,\ldots,9\}, e.g. `-4.20e6`
- leading zeros of multi-digit integer part is ignored, e.g. `02` is `2`
- purely fractional number doesn't require integer part of zero, e.g. `0.141` can be written as `.141`



Distance Types
 length
Other Types
  color, image



## Size

<!-- ToDo: check -->

- length units ???
- absolute units only good for print, except `px`
- variable units preferable, including `px`
- write without whitespace, e.g. `1px`
- unit can only be omitted for `0`

### Absolute length units

<!-- ToDo: check -->

| unit | name | definition |
| - | - | - |
| `in` | inches | 1 in = 2.54 cm |
| `cm` | centimeters | - |
| `pc` | picas | 1 pc := 12 pt ≈ 0.42 cm |
| `mm` | millimeters | 1 mm = 0.1 cm |
| `pt` | points | 1 pt := 1/72 in ≈ 0.35 mm |
| `px` | pixels | 1 px := 1/96 in ≈ 0.26 mm |

- on low resolution screens all absolute units are defined in relation to the `px`, therefore equally inaccurate
- In the past one CSS pixel was mapped to one device pixel. If the screen resolution was not exactly 96 DPPI (device pixels per inch), this would not map one CSS inch to one physical inch. E.g. for a screen with 200 DPPI, 1 CSS pixel should be 200/96 ≈ 2 device pixels. If it is mapped one to one, 1 CSS inch would only be ~1/2 physical inch. On newer screens CSS pixels are mapped over multiple device pixels and use anti-aliasing if the DPPI happens to not be an exact integer multiple of 96. On modern screens 96 px should be closer to 1 physical inch

### Relative length units

<!-- ToDo: check -->

| unit | description |
| - | - |
| `em` | current font-size of element |
| `rem` | current font-size of root element |
| `ex` | x-height in current font-size of element |
| `ch` | 0-width in current font-size of element |
| `lh` | current line height of element |
| `%` | % of parent element's value for corresponding property |
| `vw` | % of viewport's width |
| `vh` | % of viewport's height |
| `vmin` | % of viewport's smaller dimension |
| `vmax` | % of viewport's larger dimension |
|  |  |

- viewport is browser window ?? visible page window, without tab bar etc.
- `ex`, `ch`, rarely used since vary with font-family
- beware: `em`, `%` are affected by inheritance ❗️
- use `rem` to tie it to system font size ???, `em` if wants to tie to element where in



## Colors

<!-- ToDo: check -->

- can identify by name, function ??

### Name

- 140 predefined color names, e.g. `tomato`, `orange`, etc.

### RGB (Red, Green, Blue)

- intensity of colors red, green, blue from 0 to 255, black if r = g = b = 0, white if r = g = b = 255, grey if r = g = b for any other value
- `rgb(r, g, b)` for 0 <= r, g, b <= 255 in decimal
- `#(r, g, b)` for 00 <= r, g, b <= ff in hexadecimal
- `rgba(r, g, b, a)` for additional 0 <= a <= 1 transparency, can also use `rgb(r, g, b, a)` in recent browsers

### HSL (Hue, Sturation, Lightness)

- hue: degree on color wheel, from 0 to 360, red is 0, green is 120, blue is 240
- saturation: intensity of color, from 0% to 100%, grey to full color
- lightness: lightness of color, from 0% to 100%, black to white
- `hsl(h, s, l)` for 0 <= h <= 360, 0% <= s,l <= 100%
- `hsla(h, s, l, a)` for additional 0 <= a <= 1 transparenty, can also use `hsla(h, s, l, a)` in recent browsers
