## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- language to describe stule of a markup document, e.g. HTML
- domain-specific declarative programming language, i.e. what to do, not how to do it
- describes _presentation_ of content and _layout_ of Web page
- for _structure_ see CSS, for _behavior_ see JavaScript, e.g. bold text could be bold because it is emphasised (HTML) or because it looks better (CSS)
- file extension `.css`
- whitespace is collapsed to single space, like in LaTeX, i.e. line breaks, indentation etc. just for readability



## Document structure

- made up of rule-sets, sequenced linearly
- rule-sets specify the presentation of the selected element(s)

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

- selector: `h1`, `p`, etc.
- declaration: `color: red`, `font-size: 12px`, etc.
- declaration block: `{ ... }`
- rule(-set), "style": `h1 { ... }`, `p { ... }`, etc



## Rule-set

```css
selector1, selector2 {
  property1: value1;
  property2: value2;
}
```

- selector selects the element(s) the style is applied to
- properties in declaration block get applied to element(s)
- if value contains spaces needs quotation marks, e.g. `font-family: "Helvetica Neue"`
- semicolon only required between declarations, last semicolon optional, recommended for easier extension
- use separate rule-sets for common stylings, can then combine individually, e.g. for `<p class="green bold">..</p>`, beware: too much classes, "classitis", see The Cascade



## Types

### External üëç

- style in separate .css file
- reference .css in `<link>` element anywhere in `<head>` section

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="...css">
```

- can omit `type` attribute since CSS is default style language
- best practice, separates CSS from HTML
- separates presentation from content, reduces complexity and repetition, offers more flexibility and control

### Internal üëé

- style in .html file
- style in `<style>` element anywhere in `<head>` section

```html
<style>...</style>
```

- not recommended, mixes CSS with HTML
- needs to duplicate to use on different page

### Inline üëé

- style in .html file
- declarations in `style` attribute of single HTML element
- no selector is needed since element is known

```html
<tagname style="property1: value1; property2: value2;">...</tagname>
```

- not recommended, mixes CSS with HTML
- needs to duplicate to use on different elements



## Selectors

```css
selector1 {
  /* ... */
}
```

- specifies element(s) the style is applied to
- like search operator, selects all elements that match the query
- can select by type, relationship, attributes, states, etc.
- mostly case insensitive, except for some attributes, e.g. `id`, `class`
- can combine selectors for very specific selections, e.g. `a#myid:hover`

### Basic selectors

| selector | selected elements |
| - | - |
| `myelement` | elements of this _element type_ |
| `#myid` | single unique element with this _ID-attribute_ |
| `.myclass` | elements with this _class-attribute_ |
| `*` | elements of any element type, i.e. _all elements_ |

### Combinator selectors

| selector | selected elements |
| - | - |
| `myel1 myel2` | elements of type `myel2` that are _descendants_ of elements with type `myel1`, not only immediate children |
| `myel1 > myel2` | elements of type `myel2` that are _children_ of elements with type `myel1`, only immediate descendants |
| `myel1 ~ myel2` | elements of type `myel2` that are _general siblings_ of elements with type `myel1`, i.e. all elements after `myel1` in same tree depth |
| `myel1 + myel2` | elements of type `myel2` that are _adjacent siblings_ of elements with type `myel1`, i.e. single elements directly after `myel1` in same tree depth |

### Attribute selectors

| selector | selected elements |
| - | - |
| `[attr]` | elements with this _attribute_ |
| `[attr="val"]` | elements with this _attribute and value_ |
| `[attr*="val"]` | elements with this attribute _containing_ this value |
| `[attr~="val"]` | elements with this attribute _containing_ this value surrounded only by spaces |
| `[attr^="val"]` | elements with this attribute _starting_ with this value |
| `[attr$="val"]` | elements with this attribute _ending_ with this value |
| `[attr|="val"]` | elements with this attribute _starting_ with this value followed only by a hypen |

### Pseudo-class selectors

| selector | selected elements |
| - | - |
| `:psuedoclass` | elements in a certain state, like class of elements in this state, but no real class |
| `:link` | links _not yet visited_, i.e. `<a>`, `<link>`, `<area>` |
| `:visited` | links _already visited_, i.e. `<a>`, `<link>`, `<area>` |
| `:hover` | elements _moused-over_ |
| `:active` | elements _selected_ |
| `:first-child` | elements that are _first children_ of their parents |
| `:first-of-type` | elements that are _first of their type_ inside their parents |
| `:nth-child(n)` | elements that are _nth children_ of their parents |
| `:nth-of-type(n)` | elements that are nth of their type_ inside their parents |
| `:focus` | elements _in focus_ |
| ... | ... |

- `:link`, `:visited`, `:hover`, `:active` overwrite each other, must be in this order to work as expected

### Pseudo-element selectors

| selector | selected elements |
| - | - |
| `::pseudoelement` | certain part of an element, like elements of this kind, but no real elements |
| `::first-line` | _first line_ of text in element |
| `::first-letter` | _first letter_ of text in element |
| `::before` | _before the content_ of element, still within content |
| `::after` | _after the content_ of element, still within content |
| `::selection` | _selected part_ of an element |

- (pre CSS2 syntax used single colon like for pseudo-class, still backwards compatible)



## Properties and values

```css
property1: value1;
```

- a specific style property ???
- case insensitive
- user agent has default style, needs to overwrite if wants to change, "unset" / "normalize", e.g. `<h1>` is big and bold

<!-- ToDo: Finish -->

| property | values | description | default |
| - | - | - | - |
| `color` | see Color | text color | |
| `background-color` | see Color | background color | |
| `font-family` | string | text font | `"Times New Roman"` |
| `font-size` | see Size ??? | text size | `16px` |
| `text-align` | [`center`, `left`, ...] | text alignment | `left` ?? |
| `border` | ??? | border size, color ??? | |
| `padding` | | | |
| `margin` | | | |
| `text-decoration` | | | |
| `width`, `height` | | | |
| `background` | | | |
| `display` | | | |
| `position` | | | |
| `float` | | | |

- font must be installed on OS



## Inheritance

- properties can get inherited to descendant elements, saves lot of work, e.g. not setting color for every individual element
- depends on descendant element and property if inherits by default, most text styling properties get inherited by default, e.g. `<a>` doesn't inherit `color` by default
- a separate property value of a descendant overwrites inheritance
- universal property values control inheritance, accepted by all properties
  - `inherit`: inherit value from parent, e.g. `a {color: inherit}` takes text color from parent
  - `initial`: browser default value, e.g. `a {color: initial}` is blue
  - `unset`: like `inherit` if property is usually inherited, initial if not, e.g. `a {color: unset}` inherits, because `color` is inherited by default
- use inheritance for main style, style only exceptions manually



## The cascade

- algorithm to determine style of an element

1. Find all rules, and apply all declarations
    - can come from different origins or different selectors
    - if for one property there are multiple declarations, go to 2.
2. Sort declarations by origin and importance, and apply most specific
    - origins of stylesheet: user agent, user, author
    - importance of declaration: `!important` after property value
    - order: user agent < user agent `!important` < user < author < author `!important` < user `!important`
    - order of author: ex-/internal < inline
    - if declarations have same origin and importance, go to 3.
3. Sort declarations by selector specificity, and apply most specific
    - specificity: weight of a selector, determined by sub-selector types
    - order: (pseudo-)element < (pseudo-)class, attribute < ID
    - order of sub-selectors doesn't matter, just quantity with highest ranking
    - universal selector, combinators, negation pseudo-class have no specificity
    - styling attributes have no specificity (shouldn't be used anyways)
    - if declarations have same selector specificity, go to 4.
4. Sort declarations by rule appearance, and apply last defined

- CSS applies all rules, only for conflicting declarations it uses the one from the most specific rule
- user stylesheet with `!important` wins, because accessibility requires custom style 
- don't use `!important`, skips specificity, can't be overwritten easily
- use least specific selector, so can overwrite easily later
- order doesn't matter for specificity selector, just quantity of selectors  
  `body p` = `main p`, `.myclass#myid` = `#myid.myclass`  
  `p#myid` < `p#myid.myclass` < `p#myid#myid`  
  (can artificially increase specificity by chaining same ID or class)
- use least amount of selectors, so can overwrite easily later
- use inheritance instead of individual rules, make rules only for exceptions, write same code only once
- use semantic elements with styles, instead of non-semantic one with classes, defies separation of content and styling since must remember adding class for every element, "classitis" is overuse of classes to style everything



## Colors

<!-- ToDo: check -->

- can identify by name, function ??

### Name

- 140 predefined color names, e.g. `tomato`, `orange`, etc.

### RGB (Red, Green, Blue)

- intensity of colors red, green, blue from 0 to 255, black if r = g = b = 0, white if r = g = b = 255, grey if r = g = b for any other value
- `rgb(r, g, b)` for 0 <= r, g, b <= 255 in decimal
- `#(r, g, b)` for 00 <= r, g, b <= ff in hexadecimal
- `rgba(r, g, b, a)` for additional 0 <= a <= 1 transparency, can also use `rgb(r, g, b, a)` in recent browsers

### HSL (Hue, Sturation, Lightness)

- hue: degree on color wheel, from 0 to 360, red is 0, green is 120, blue is 240
- saturation: intensity of color, from 0% to 100%, grey to full color
- lightness: lightness of color, from 0% to 100%, black to white
- `hsl(h, s, l)` for 0 <= h <= 360, 0% <= s,l <= 100%
- `hsla(h, s, l, a)` for additional 0 <= a <= 1 transparenty, can also use `hsla(h, s, l, a)` in recent browsers



## Size

<!-- ToDo: check -->

- length units ???
- absolute units only good for print, except `px`
- variable units preferable, including `px`
- write without whitespace, e.g. `1px`
- unit can only be omitted for `0`

### Absolute length units

<!-- ToDo: check -->

| unit | name | definition |
| - | - | - |
| `in` | inches | 1 in = 2.54 cm |
| `cm` | centimeters | - |
| `pc` | picas | 1 pc := 12 pt ‚âà 0.42 cm |
| `mm` | millimeters | 1 mm = 0.1 cm |
| `pt` | points | 1 pt := 1/72 in ‚âà 0.35 mm |
| `px` | pixels | 1 px := 1/96 in ‚âà 0.26 mm |

- on low resolution screens all absolute units are defined in relation to the `px`, therefore equally inaccurate
- In the past one CSS pixel was mapped to one device pixel. If the screen resolution was not exactly 96 DPPI (device pixels per inch), this would not map one CSS inch to one physical inch. E.g. for a screen with 200 DPPI, 1 CSS pixel should be 200/96 ‚âà 2 device pixels. If it is mapped one to one, 1 CSS inch would only be ~1/2 physical inch. On newer screens CSS pixels are mapped over multiple device pixels and use anti-aliasing if the DPPI happens to not be an exact integer multiple of 96. On modern screens 96 px should be closer to 1 physical inch

### Relative length units

<!-- ToDo: check -->

| unit | description |
| - | - |
| `em` | current font-size of element |
| `rem` | current font-size of root element |
| `ex` | x-height in current font-size of element |
| `ch` | 0-width in current font-size of element |
| `lh` | current line height of element |
| `%` | % of parent element's value for corresponding property |
| `vw` | % of viewport's width |
| `vh` | % of viewport's height |
| `vmin` | % of viewport's smaller dimension |
| `vmax` | % of viewport's larger dimension |
|  |  |

- viewport is browser window ?? visible page window, without tab bar etc.
- beware: `em`, `%` are affected by inheritance
- `ex`, `ch`, rarely used since vary with font-family
