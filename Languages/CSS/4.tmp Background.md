<!-- new, integrate in Box when ready -->

## Background

<!-- ToDo: Finish, see css-background-3 -->

Each box has a background layer that may be fully transparent (the default), or filled with a color and/or one or more images. The background properties specify what color (background-color) and images (background-image) to use, and how they are sized, positioned, tiled, etc.

The background properties are not inherited, but the parent boxâ€™s background will shine through by default because of the initial transparent value on background-color.

background of the content, padding and border areas


- `background` of element styles background of content, padding and border area of box
- also `border` of element styles background of border area of bo
- background of margin area is always transparent, i.e. margin is "invisible", background of outer box shines through

background of element box by default within the padding edges
can be adjusted using the background-origin and background-clip properties

background by default within border edges ?!?!, overriden by initial value of border-color, can be seen with border-color: transparent


background-clip: sets whether an element's background extends underneath its border box (default), padding box, or content box
beware: solid border style masks the difference, needs to be opaque, dashed, etc.
