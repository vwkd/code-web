# Viewport

[TOC]



## Introduction

- visible area where document is rendered, i.e. user agent window excluding menu bar, etc.
- includes overlayed controls, don't affect viewport, e.g. scrollbars, on-screen keyboard, etc.
- 2D coordinate system, origin in top left corner
- layout adapts to viewport, e.g. line width
- document might overflow, be larger than viewport
- viewport doesn't include overflow area
- user agent offers scrolling mechanism for overflow area
iframe, objects, SVG, create own viewport for content, content doesn't know it's embedded, "sees" only viewport of iframe

??## Zoom

beware: will assume screen, not paged media ❗️
all length units are (eventually) relative to pixel unit, e.g. through initial value, value of property they depend on, etc.
even viewport-relative units since size of viewport is set in pixel
if scales pixel unit, everything scales with it


two methods of zooming: page zoom and page scale



??## Mobile

instead of starting LV with device-width, scales down px to make width 980px
seems like rendered on 980px screen, then shrunk down
but actually makes use of VV and LV?!?!?!

mobile browsers by default report a large LV width, e.g. 980px on iOS Safari
then scale down everything to fit actual viewport width, page scale zoom out, make VV as wide as LV ?!?!
user can then page scale inwards
necessary to make unoptimised websites viewable on small screens
when designs a mobile compatible page, need to disable this feature with viewport meta tag

viewport meta sets initial dimensions of the layout viewport
meaning dimensions of VV change, usually wants LV to equal VV, no zooming applied, can fully define layout mobile first using media rules

only use viewport meta tag if page is actually responsive, otherwise user needs to zoom out to see the whole page

can set to any width, but usually sets to device-width, specified by device manufacturer what the pixel value is (not device pixels!)
initial-scale does same thing as percentage of device-width
use both to avoid implementation bugs, e.g. iOS Safari not updating device-width on rotation
-> actually presentation instead of semantics, but needs to be known before HTML body is parsed for responsive images, viewport-at-rule was removed from CSS spec [#258](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/258), [#4766](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4766)

## Types of zooming

### Text zoom

- default font-size in user agent settings
- specifies initial value of `font-size` property, by default `medium` is `16px`
- scales font-relative length units if (eventually) depend on initial value of `font-size`, e.g. `rem`, or "`em`-chain" from root element downwards
- beware: doesn't scale any other length unit, e.g. pixel unit, viewport-relative units, `em` when reference `font-size` is non-relative, etc. ❗️
- may change layout of page
- to enable, only use font-relative units
- to block, only use absolute units, or relative units that don't depend on initial value of `font-size`, e.g. absolute unit for `font-size` of root element, no relative units outside of property values, e.g. in media query

### Page zoom

- keyboard zoom
- scales pixel unit
- but viewport stays same size, doesn't scale with pixel unit, i.e. its size in pixels shrinks
doesn't change logical size of viewport, becomes smaller if pixel unit grows and vice versa
- beware: viewport-relative units don't appear to scale since relative to viewport
all units depending on viewport-relative units don't appear to scale, e.g. percentage or non-viewport relative length units
can get overflow, usually messes up layout
beware: may get additional overflow, since viewport doesn't scale
- beware: elements with `position: fixed` will block view, can't scroll out of the way, e.g. header bar
- may change layout of page
i.e. affects layout of page
- to enable, don't use viewport-relative length units, don't use `position: fixed`, handle overflow
- to block, only use viewport-relative length units

### Page scale

- zooming gestures
- scales pixel unit and viewport
- 
see Two viewports
- doesn't change layout of page
- always enabled, can not enable or block
- replaces page zoom, avoids problem of fixed positioned elements, viewport-relative units don't scale


## Two viewports

- separate viewport into two distinct conceptual viewports, one from perspective of page, one from perspective of user
- LV is viewport from perspective of page, doesn't change size relative to page
- VV is viewport from perspective of screen, doesn't change size relative to screen
- if pixel unit is scaled, from perspective of page the size of LV stays same size and VV shrinks
- if pixel unit is scaled, from perspective of screen the LV grows and VV stays same size
- layout of page doesn't change since relative to layout viewport, i.e. page doesn't notice it's scaled
- can think of as using a magnifying glass, doesn't change page
- beware: value of pixel unit is from perspective of page, i.e. LV stays same size while VV shrinks ❗️


LV is what page sees as viewport, doesn't change relative to page, but relative to user (grows)
VV is what user sees as viewport, doesn't change relative to user, but relative to page (shrinks)
LV = VV for t=0, before zoom
but size of pixel unit doesn't need to match reference pixel, can be much smaller, e.g. device-width seems 960px on iPhone
allows desktop pages to look small but normal layout, user can page scale closer, need viewport meta tag to disable

unbundles what sees (VV), from what is used to calculate layout (LV),
doesn't change logical size of VV, meaning it becomes smaller since pixels grow, but LV grows with pixels, i.e. layout doesn't change at all

VV: region of the web page currently visible after zooming & overlays, appears constant size to user, appears to shrink from perspective of page
LV: region of the web page visible without zooming & overlays ???
position: fixed elements attach to LV

pixel unit and LV scale up, VV stays constant
but size of LV IN PIXEL UNITS doesn't change, size of VV IN PIXEL UNITS shrinks

- second viewport, only used for view
- make zooming independent from layout

split the notion of "the viewport" into two, "the layout viewport" (where fixed position items are attached) and "the visual viewport" (What the users actually see).

changes logical size of LV, grows with pixel unit, therefore also viewport-relative units scale, everything scales
from point of page nothing changes, isn't aware of any scaling, like with time dilation where whole system slows down doesn't notice from within system
what 

-> doesn't recompute anything of layout, fast, doesn't change layout at all
-> fixed positioned elements don't block view, stick to LV not VV

page doesn't notice at all, for user just like magnifying glass
page doesn't know there is a VV, isn't aware that only part of it is visible, 

can get VV via VV API in JS

part of the page that’s visible
part of PAGE, because it's size in document units changes depending on zoom, but real size on screen doesn't change
all units are relative to LV, stay constant from point of view of page since LV scales with page
units from point of view of page that matter, not real units from point of view of screen

page doesn't need to know about zoom, all sizes relative to layout viewport, e.g. `windows.innerWidth`/`innerHeight`, etc.

changing orientation only changes VV, not LV, otherwise page would flip with it

beware: this is weird, since LV appears to grow while VV stays constant, but for size the VV shrinks while the LV stays same size
since size is measured in units relative to LV!!!


(beware: for page zoom there is no virtual viewport, just inline overflow that can be scrolled into view)

whole page is scaled up, only smaller part of it is visible
page doesn't "know" it's scaled, sizes relative to each other remain the same, can think of as LV being scaled up with it
VV is what LV was before, visible part of document, stays same size
but actually since sizes don't change, the LV remains at same size and instead the VV scales down






as if LV and page were scaled up, VV is what "sees", LV stays fixed relative to page, VV can move around
but values of units don't change, i.e. width, height, etc. stay the same value, but appear bigger, everything is scaled up
so for size is opposite, size of LV stays constant, while size of VV scales down
from point of page as if outside viewer shrunk (making it appear bigger to him), LV didn't chang from point of view of page

can think of "layout viewport" and "visible viewport"
beware: page and LV don't change, VV is construct to explain upscaling of everything


:what the user sees:

separates layout from visibility
from point of page layout viewport grows with zoom, and visual viewport stays the same, VV always smaller than LV
from point of browser layout viewport stays the same, virtual viewport shrinks to region of page, VV always smaller than LV

units don't change ?!?!?!?!
fixed elements are positioned wrt LV, don't block view anymore by not moving / being scrollable as it is case with page zoom
like magnifying glass for user, nothing moves around (by not moving wrt viewport)
page doesn't notice that it's zoomed, behaves just as before

VV made smaller by overlaying non-zoomable areas, other than LV, e.g. scrollbars, on-screen keyboards, etc.

show smaller portion of document on whole viewport

part of the web page that is currently visible ??? portion of part originally visible in viewport, then scaled up to fill viewport
portion of the viewport that is currently visible ??? BAD SINCE LAYOUT VIEWPORT IS ALWAYS VISIBLE IN FULL
is same or smaller than layout viewport
"virtual" viewport, as if only looks at portion of layout viewport, e.g. by pinch-zooming, not font-size zooming

normal zooming scales the pixel unit, therefore all other absolute length units, relative lenght units are somewhere grounded by absolute length units as well, except viewport-relative, changes layout of page



beware: by definition layout viewport is always visible, doesn't change, is never "not visible", is never "outside"

- "real" viewport also called layout viewport
- layout viewport doesn't change when interacts with document alone (not ua window)

page scale only affects VV of top-level windows, not of embedded viewports, e.g. iframe, SVG, etc.

mobile browsers may render content in virtual viewport that is wider than real viewport, then shrink viewport down to real viewport, makes webpage look small, can then page scale in
can control using a viewport meta tag in HTML head


Visual Viewport API provides a mechanism for querying and modifying the properties of the visual viewport.
beware: also called "visual" viewport, but confusing since real viewport is also visible / visual


from point of view of document don't need to worry about zoom, just make accessible, 

`position: fixed` fixes position relative to layout viewport, not visual viewport



## Visual Viewport API

## Introduction

- visualViewport object of a window object
- 

querying and modifying the properties of the visual viewport

allows to fix position to VV instead of LV, e.g. image controls, text formatting bar, etc.

 fires resize and scroll events when VV changes (therefore also when LV changes since VV must be smaller than LV)
doesn't bubble

beware: only for top-level window VV is different from LV, i.e. in iframe, SVG, etc. VV object is not useful
 Each window on a page will have a unique VisualViewport object
