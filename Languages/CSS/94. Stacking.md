# Stacking

[TOC]



<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction



beware: other properties may introduce stacking contexts, for example 'opacity'
 transforms, filters, css-regions, paged media, and possibly others.


nested elements have same stack order ??
sibling elements that are overlayed behave like a stack??

hover only registers on the most above element in the stack!
