## Introduction

out-of-flow boxes are stacked on z-axis
controlled by z-index
grows out of screen
beware: positive z-axis in right handed corrdinate system is into screen, z-index is opposite ⚠️

??values: `auto` (default), `<number>` ??
auto means zero???

beware: other properties may introduce stacking contexts, for example 'opacity'
 transforms, filters, css-regions, paged media, and possibly others.


nested elements have same stack order ??
sibling elements that are overlayed behave like a stack??

hover only registers on the most above element in the stack!
