<!-- Pasted in Flex Layout -->
## Alignment

<!-- todo: baseline, see css-alignment 4.2, 5.4, 9, css-align -->
<!-- todo: overflow, see css-alignment 5.3, css-overflow -->

- positioning of boxes within free space
- beware: works with both positive / negative free space, i.e. can align overflow ❗️
- use terms "justify" / "align" for alignment along main / cross axis
- beware: differs from other layouts were uses "justify" / "align" for alignment along inline / block axis, i.e. for `flex-direction: column(-reverse)` is exactly oppositely along block / inline axis ⚠️
- final step after determining size of boxes, margins, gutters, etc.
- beware: flexible sizing may have "eaten up" free space, except if grown / shrunk size hit limit of maximum / minimum size, or if distributes less than 100% of free space due to factors being smaller than one ❗️
- beware: `auto` margins "eat up" any positive free space, but not negative ❗️
- beware: alignment properties have no effect if there is no free space ❗️

### Content distribution

- alignment of content within content box of flex container

#### `align-content`

- specifies alignment of flex lines in flex container along cross axis
- not inherited
- applies to multi-line flex containers
- beware: doesn't apply to single-line flex container since single line is always full cross size ❗️
- beware: has no effect if flex container has `auto` cross size since no free space ❗️
- values: `normal`, `stretch`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`, `center`, `start`, `end`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`
- initial value: `normal`

##### `normal`

- behaves as `stretch`

##### `stretch`

- flex lines grow to fill the container in the cross dimension
- size is grown equally, not proportionally

##### `start` / `end`

- flex lines are packed to the flex container’s start / end side in the cross dimension
- beware: for `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse` differs from `flex-start` / `-end` ❗️
- beware: don't use, instead use `flex-start` / `-end` ❗️

##### `flex-start` / `-end`

- flex lines are packed to the flex container’s cross-start / end side in the cross dimension
- beware: not a legacy version of the `start` / `end` value ❗️

#### `justify-content`

- specifies alignment of flex items in a flex line along main axis
- beware: confusing, since aligns items instead of lines, like `justify-items` with different values and without `justify-self` for children ⚠️
- not inherited
- applies to flex containers
- beware: applies to all lines since can't target individual lines, see Grid Layout instead ❗️
- values: `normal`, `stretch`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`, `center`, `start`, `end`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`
- initial value: `normal`

##### `normal`

- behaves as `stretch`

##### `stretch`

- behaves as `flex-start`
- for stretching use `flex-grow` instead
- beware: shouldn't have existed in Flex Layout ❗️

##### `start` / `end`

- flex items are packed to the flex container’s start / end side in the main dimension
- beware: for `flex-direction: *-reverse` differs from `flex-start` / `-end` ❗️
- beware: don't use, instead use `flex-start` / `-end` ❗️

##### `flex-start` / `-end`

- flex items are packed to the flex container’s main-start / end side in the main dimension
- beware: not a legacy version of the `start` / `end` value ❗️

#### `place-content`

- shorthand for `align-content` and `justify-content`
- first `align-content`, then optional `justify-content`
- if `justify-content` is omitted is set to `align-content`

### Self-alignment

- alignment of margin box of flex item within parent

#### `align-self`

- specifies alignment of flex item in flex line along cross axis
- beware: only has effect if free space in flex line, e.g. line stretches, or other items in line have larger cross sizes ❗️
- not inherited
- applies to flex items
- values: `auto`, `normal`, `stretch`, `center`, `start`, `end`, `self-start`, `self-end`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`
- initial value: `auto`

##### `auto`

- computes to value of `align-items` of parent

##### `normal`

- behaves as `stretch`

##### `stretch`

- flex item grows to fill the flex line in the cross dimension
- constrained by minimum / maximum size
- beware: can cause item to shrink to fit container as well ❗️

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Lorem ipsum</div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  border: 1px solid red;
  height: 1rem;
}

.item {
  background-color: cornflowerblue;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  font-size: 2rem;
  /* align-self: flex-start; */
}
```

##### `start` / `end`

- flex item is shifted to the flex container’s start / end side in the cross dimension
- beware: for `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse` differs from `flex-start` / `-end` ❗️
- beware: don't use, instead use `flex-start` / `-end` ❗️

##### `flex-start` / `-end`

- flex item is shifted to the flex container’s cross-start / end side in the cross dimension
- beware: not a legacy version of the `start` / `end` value ❗️

##### `self-start` / `-end`

- flex item is shifted to its own start / end side in the cross dimension
- beware: for flex item with opposite writing orientation and text directionality than parent differs from `start` / `end`, e.g. for parent with `writing-mode: horizontal-tb` and `direction: ltr` either `writing-mode: vertical-*` and `direction: rtl` or `writing-mode: sideways-lr`/`rl` and `direction: ltr`/`rtl` ❗️

#### `justify-self`
DOESN'T EXIST
since justifying is relative to other boxes

- specifies alignment of flex item in flex line along main axis
- instead use `flex-grow` for stretching and `justify-content` or `auto` margins for alignment

#### `place-self`
DOESN'T EXIST

- shorthand for `align-self` and `justify-self`
- first `align-self`, then optional `justify-self`
- if `justify-self` is omitted is set to `align-self`

### Default alignment

- alignment of margin box of flex items within parent

#### `align-items`

- specifies alignment of flex items in flex line along cross axis
- shorthand that sets the initial value of `align-self` on all children elements
- not inherited
- applies to flex container
- beware: applies to all lines since can't target individual lines, see Grid Layout instead ❗️
- values: like `align-self` but without `auto`
- initial value: `normal`, i.e. by default items have cross size of tallest item (if not bound by their maximum size or size of container) ❗️

#### `justify-items`
DOESN'T EXIST
- instead see `flex-grow` for stretching and `justify-content` for alignment

- specifies alignment of flex items in flex line along main axis
- shorthand that sets the initial value of `justify-self` on all children elements
- not inherited
- applies to flex container
- values: like `justify-self` but without `auto`
- initial value: `normal`

#### `place-items`
DOESN'T EXIST

- shorthand for `align-items` and `justify-items`
- first `align-items`, then optional `justify-items`
- if `justify-items` is omitted is set to `align-items`
