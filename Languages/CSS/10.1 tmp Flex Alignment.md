## Alignment

- positioning of boxes within free space
- beware: works with both positive / negative free space, i.e. can align overflow ❗️
- uses terms "justify"/"align" for alignment along main/cross axis
- beware: differs from other layouts were uses "justify"/"align" for alignment along inline/block axis, i.e. for `flex-direction: column(-reverse)` is exactly oppositely along block/inline axis ⚠️
- final step after determining size of boxes, including any margins
- beware: flexible sizing may have "eaten up" free space, except if grown / shrunk size hit limit of maximum / minimum size, or if distributes less than 100% of free space due to factors being smaller than one ❗️
- beware: `auto` margins "eat up" any positive free space, but not negative ❗️
- beware: alignment properties have no effect if there is no free space ❗️

### Content distribution

- specifies alignment of flex containers content within its content box 

position of element's content within its own content box
i.e. effectively adjusts padding of element

alignment subject and alignment container both assume the writing mode of the box the *-content property is set on ??? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN

space-between: default fallback alignment for this value is flex-start
space-around, space-evenly: default fallback alignment for this value is center
stretch:
any auto-sized alignment subjects have their size increased equally (not proportionally) to fill the alignment container
still respecting the constraints imposed by max-height/max-width (or equivalent functionality)
default fallback alignment for this value is flex-start

#### align-content

aligns flex lines within content box of element
beware: align-content only has effect on multi-line flex containers !
- beware: cross axis instead of block axis like in other layouts ⚠️

normal |  stretch, space-between, space-around, space-evenly | center, start, end, flex-start, flex-end
initial value: normal, behaves as stretch
applies to flex containers
not inherited

direction according to writing mode in that element ?? OR MEANDS WRITING DIRECTION

??? NOTE: stretch behaves as flex-start.

#### justify-content

aligns flex items in each line (within content box of element?)
beware: should have used flex-items for behavior of justify-content !!!
- beware: main axis instead of inline axis like in other layouts ⚠️

Value: normal | stretch, space-between, space-around, space-evenly | center, start, end, flex-start, flex-end
initial value: normal, behaves as stretch
applies to flex containers
not inherited

direction according to writing mode in that element ?? OR MEANDS WRITING DIRECTION

??? NOTE: stretch behaves as flex-start.

#### place-content

shorthand for both
Value: <'align-content'> <'justify-content'>?
Initial: normal
Applies to flex containers
Inherited: no
if second is ommitted it's copied from the first value



### Self-alignment

position of margin box of element within parent
aligns margin box of flex items within flex lines
i.e. effectively adjusts margins of elements

#### justify-self

doesn't exist
See flex for stretching and justify-content for main-axis alignment.

#### align-self

- beware: cross axis instead of block axis like in other layouts ⚠️

Value: auto | normal | stretch | center, start, end, self-start, self-end, flex-start, flex-end
Initial: auto
Applies to flex items
Inherited: no

LIKE JUSTIFY-SELF

normal behaves as stretch.

#### place-self

doesn't exist



### Default alignment

set the default align-self ~~and justify-self~~ behavior of the element’s child boxes I.E. THOSE WITH `auto`
shorthand to set all child items with *-self: auto
specify the interpretation of any *-self: auto used on children of the container

applies to flex containers

direction according to writing mode in that element ?? OR MEANDS WRITING DIRECTION

beware: The *-items properties don’t affect the element itself
specify the interpretation of any *-self: auto used on children of the container element.
