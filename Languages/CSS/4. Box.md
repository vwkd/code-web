# Box

[TOC]



## Introduction

- visual representation of elements in a document
- every element is represented as a box (*)
- document tree is transformed into box tree
- box layout defines how box tree is rendered
- style of box is taken from properties of element (*)
- (* for exact details see Layout#Box_generation)
- a box "contains" another box, if in the box tree it's a descendant of the box
- descendant box refers to box of descendant element



## Box

- rectangular content area with optional padding, border, and margin areas

![box](illustrations/box.svg)

- can think of box as consisting of four nested sub-boxes, i.e. content box, padding box, border box, and margin box
- content area contains the boxes content, e.g. text, image, descendant boxes, etc.  
(since box tree hierarchy is same as document tree hierarchy, see Layout#Box_generation)
<!-- ??? what does above comment mean??? -->
- beware: think of total box as border box, don't think of margin as part of box, see Margin ❗️
- box size automatically adapts to fit content, see Size

<!-- TODO see css-break-4
a box can "break" into fragments, e.g. end of line, end of page on print, etc.
e.g. inline-level box which establishes a flow FC and has a block-level child box
-->



<!-- ToDo: properly specify value types, initial values, non-inherited, etc., specify behavior of `auto`, etc. -->

## Padding

- transparent area between content and border
- spaces content from border
- padding properties specify thickness of padding area
- longhand `padding-*` for each side, shorthand `padding` for all four sides
- initial value is `0`
- percentage refers to _inline-size_ of containing block, i.e. _width_ in horizontal writing mode, see Writing Mode
- beware: even for `padding-block-start` and `padding-block-end`, allows same value to make equal sized padding in any direction ❗️
- beware: user agent style sheet may set any value, overrides initial value ❗️



## Border

- painted area outside of padding
- confines box
- border properties specify thickness and style of border area
- longhand `border-*-width` for each side's thickness, shorthand `border-width` for all four sides
- initial value is `medium`
- percentage is not defined ⚠️
- longhand `border-*-style` for each side's line style, shorthand `border-style` for all four sides
- initial value is `none`, color and width are ignored, i.e. no border by default ❗️
- longhand `border-*-color` for each side's color, shorthand `border-color` for all four sides
- initial value is value of `color` property
- shorthand `border-*` combines `border-*-width`, `border-*-color`, `border-*-style`, in any order
- shorthand `border` combines `border-*`, can't set different values for each side, unlike `margin` and `padding`
- beware: `border` resets all other border properties to its initial value ❗️
- beware: user agent style sheet may set any value, overrides initial value ❗️
- border is drawn above background
<!-- ToDo: add border-radius from css-background -->



## Outline

- like border, drawn around border box
- drawn "on top of" box, doesn't affect layout or size ❗️
- beware: if bigger than margin of box may overlap surroundings ❗️
- `outline-width`, `outline-style`, `outline-color`, `outline` similar to border properties
- `outline-offset` for space between outline and border box, by default `0`
- by default used for `:focus` state
- beware: don't disable for `:focus`, used for accessibility, e.g. using `all: initial` reset ⚠️



## Margin

- transparent area outside of border, see Margin

<!--  ToDo: see css-break-4
Margins adjoining a fragmentation break are sometimes truncated, e.g. on print
 -->



## Background

<!-- ToDo: incorporate tmp Background -->

background-image is drawn above background-color



## Color

<!-- ToDo: see css-color -->

color of an element's content (usually text).

beware: `color` should have been named `font-color` ❗️
