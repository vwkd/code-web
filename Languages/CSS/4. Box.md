# Box

[TOC]



## Introduction

- visual representation of elements in a document
- every element is represented as a box (*)
- document tree is transformed into box tree
- box layout defines how box tree is rendered
- style of box is taken from properties of element (*)
- (* for exact details see Layout#Box_generation)
- a box "contains" another box, if in the box tree it's a descendant of the box
- descendant box refers to box of descendant element



## Box

- rectangular content area with optional padding, border, and margin areas

![box](illustrations/box.svg)

- can think of box as consisting of four sub-boxes, i.e. content box, padding box, border box, and margin box
- think of margin box not as part of box, instead as spacing between boxes, see Size#Sizing_Box
- content area contains the boxes content, e.g. text, image, descendant boxes, etc.  
(since box tree hierarchy is same as document tree hierarchy, see Layout#Box_generation)
<!-- ??? what does above comment mean??? -->
- box size automatically adapts to fit content, see Size

<!-- TODO see css-break-4
a box can "break" into fragments, e.g. end of line, end of page on print, etc.
e.g. inline-level box which establishes a flow FC and has a block-level child box
-->



<!-- ToDo: properly specify value types, initial values, non-inherited, etc., specify behavior of `auto`, etc. -->

## Margin

- spacing of box from other boxes, transparent
- margin properties specify thickness of margin area
- longhand `margin-*` for each side, shorthand `margin` for all four sides
- margin can be negative
<!-- ??? results in what? controlled overflow of parent box ? NO?!?!

creates overlap, see Stacking how is handled, e.g. ODT `inline` elements are above ODT `block` elements !!! -->
- initial value is `0`, beware: user agent style sheet may set a value ❗️
- percentage refers to _width_ of containing block, beware: even for `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` ❗️
- beware: vertical margins have no effect on inline-level boxes, see Flow Layout
- can use `auto` value to center box that is smaller than available space, e.g. `width: 50%; margin: 0 auto`
<!-- ?? only works for box with non-`auto` size ?? only works if parent has non-`auto` size as well instead of growing with content ??? -->
- beware: historical bug of margin collapse, see Margin Collapse ⚠️
- beware: avoid using margins due to margin collapse, instead use gap properties in Flex and Grid Layout ⚠️

<!--  ToDo: see css-break-4
Margins adjoining a fragmentation break are sometimes truncated, e.g. on print
 -->



## Padding

- spacing of content from border, transparent
- padding properties specify thickness of padding area
- longhand `padding-*` for each side, shorthand `padding` for all four sides
- initial value is `0`
- percentage refers to _width_ of containing block, beware: even for `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` ❗️
- beware: user agent style sheet may set any value, overrides initial value ❗️



## Border

- confinement of box
- border properties specify thickness and style of border area
- longhand `border-*-width` for each side's thickness, shorthand `border-width` for all four sides
- initial value is `medium`
- percentage is not defined ⚠️
- longhand `border-*-style` for each side's line style, shorthand `border-style` for all four sides
- initial value is `none`, color and width are ignored, i.e. no border by default ❗️
- longhand `border-*-color` for each side's color, shorthand `border-color` for all four sides
- initial value is value of `color` property
- shorthand `border-*` combines `border-*-width`, `border-*-color`, `border-*-style`, in any order
- shorthand `border` combines `border-*`, can't set different values for each side, unlike `margin` and `padding`
- beware: `border` resets all other border properties to its initial value ❗️
- beware: user agent style sheet may set any value, overrides initial value ❗️
- border is drawn above background
<!-- ToDo: add border-radius from css-background -->


## Outline

- like border, drawn around border box
- drawn "on top of" box, doesn't affect layout or size ❗️
- beware: if bigger than margin of box may overlap surroundings ❗️
- `outline-width`, `outline-style`, `outline-color`, `outline` similar to border properties
- `outline-offset` for space between outline and border box, by default `0`
- by default used for `:focus` state
- beware: don't disable for `:focus`, used for accessibility, e.g. using `all: initial` reset ⚠️



## Background

<!-- ToDo: incorporate tmp Background -->

background-image is drawn above background-color



## Color

<!-- ToDo: see css-color -->

color of an element's content (usually text).

beware: `color` should have been named `font-color` ❗️
