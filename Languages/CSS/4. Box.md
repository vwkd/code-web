# Box

[TOC]



## Introduction

- visual representation of elements in a document
- every element is represented as a box (*)
- document tree is transformed into box tree
- box layout defines how box tree is rendered
- style of box is taken from properties of element (*)
- (* for exact details see Box generation)
- a box "contains" another box, if in the box tree it's a descendant of the box
- descendant box refers to box of descendant element



## Box

- rectangular content area with optional padding, border, and margin areas

![box](illustrations/box.svg)

- can think of box as consisting of four sub-boxes, i.e. content box, padding box, border box, and margin box
- content area contains the boxes content, e.g. text, image, descendant boxes, etc.
(since box tree hierarchy is same as document tree hierarchy, see Box generation)
- box size automatically adapts to fit content
- beware: descendant boxes can "overflow" their containing block, but actual content like text, image, not, see ???

<!-- TODO see css-break-4
a box can "break" into fragments, e.g. end of line, end of page on print, etc.
e.g. inline-level box which establishes a flow FC and has a block-level child box
-->



## Margin

- visually separates box from other boxes
- margin properties specify thickness of margin area
- longhand `margin-*` for each side, shorthand `margin` for all four sides
- margin can be negative, results in ??? controlled overflow of parent box ??
- initial value is `0`, beware: user agent style sheet may set a value ❗️
- percentage refers to _width_ of containing block, beware: even for `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` ❗️
- beware: vertical margins have no effect on inline-level boxes, see Flow Layout
- can use `auto` value to center box that is smaller than available space, e.g. `width: 50%; margin: 0 auto`
- beware: historical bug of margin collapse, see Margin Collapse ⚠️
- beware: avoid using margins due to margin collapse, instead use gap properties in Flex and Grid Layout ⚠️

<!--  ToDo: see css-break-4
Margins adjoining a fragmentation break are sometimes truncated, e.g. on print
 -->



## Padding

- visually separates content from border
- padding properties specify thickness of padding area
- longhand `padding-*` for each side, shorthand `padding` for all four sides
- initial value is `0`
- percentage refers to _width_ of containing block, beware: even for `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` ❗️
- beware: user agent style sheet may set any value, overrides initial value ❗️



## Border

- visually confines box
beware: whole box still includes margin area, there is no empty space between boxes, all boxes touch each other, just margin is transparent ❗️
- border properties specify thickness and style of border area
- longhand `border-*-width` for each side's thickness, shorthand `border-width` for all four sides
- initial value is `medium`
- percentage is not defined ⚠️
- longhand `border-*-style` for each side's line style, shorthand `border-style` for all four sides
- initial value is `none`, color and width are ignored, i.e. no border by default ❗️
- longhand `border-*-color` for each side's color, shorthand `border-color` for all four sides
- initial value is value of `color` property
- shorthand `border-*` combines `border-*-width`, `border-*-color`, `border-*-style`, in any order
- shorthand `border` combines `border-*`, can't set different values for each side, unlike `margin` and `padding`
- beware: `border` resets all other border properties to its initial value ❗️
- beware: user agent style sheet may set any value, overrides initial value ❗️



## Outline

- like border, but drawn "on top of" box, doesn't affect layout
- `outline-width`, `outline-style`, `outline-color`, `outline` similar to border properties
- by default used for `:focus` state
- beware: don't disable for `:focus`, used for accessibility



## Background

<!-- ToDo: incorporate tmp Background -->



## Color

<!-- ToDo: see css-color -->

color of an element's content (usually text).
