### Generated content

- acts as if it is a child node of the element it is generated on, for the purposes of positioning

- can set element `position: relative` and its pseudo-element with `position: absolute` relative to it

- The chunk of content is not added to the DOM, but can be styled like a DOM node, i.e. not visible to screen readers, not manipulatable using JavaScript etc.
