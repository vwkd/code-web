## Size

<!-- from MDN -->

by default size so that at least fits content, intrinsic size, natural size
can be bigger, e.g. block

can disable "auto sizing" by giving specific size, extrinsic size
may be sized smaller than content, content overflows
doesn't adapt anymore to content size, e.g. when resizing viewport
-> very careful with fixing size, content may overflow
??don't confuse with replaced content, e.g. image, has no content, is itself the content, different than other elements which contain something, e.g. text

properties: width and height, inline-size and block-size, min-/max-"
usually?? percentage of the width of the parent container. ?? or containing block
??percentage refers to _width_ of containing block, beware: even for `height` properties ❗️
??min-* is safe as doesn't prevent growing, rest unsafe, since prevents growing ?? max-width of images scales down !!

by default size of content-area, can use box-sizing to specify for padding-area?? or border-area instead, not for margin-area since margin collapse interferes

notes:
always specify size for images, otherwise are full size and don't scale ??
always use max-width since allows image to not be upscaled  when container grows bigger than it is


by default, width: 100% for block box, height: auto???
by default, width: auto for inline box, height: 1lh???
