# Grid Layout

[TOC]


<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction

- a regular layout, for applications
- two-dimensional layout since uses grid, for one-dimensional layout see Flex Layout
- replaces Table Layout üéâ

-----

## Grid

a set of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines
creates columns and rows

### Grid line

- line making up the grid, either horizontal or vertical
can be referred to by numerical index, or by an author-specified name

### Grid track

- a column or row, space between two adjacent grid lines
by default grid tracks are packed tightly, can use gap properties to separate 

### Grid cell

intersection of a row and a column

### Grid area

set of adjacent grid cells that form a rectangle
can be named explicitly or referenced implicitly by its bounding grid lines
used to position grid item in grid
  can place grid items into any grid area
is also containing block of grid item ??!!??
beware: affects only visual rendering, keyboard navigation and screen reader still use document tree order ‚ùóÔ∏è

can position multiple grid items in grid area ?? STACKING ORDER ?? VISUAL ORDER ??
???COPYFROMFLEXBOX beware: doesn't affect stacking order since doesn't change order of boxes but only the directions, see Visual order ‚ùóÔ∏è






columns run along the block axis
rows run along the inline axis


track sizes can be fixed, flexible, or content-based


??can create intentional overlap by putting two elements in same cell(s), not possible with Flex Layout?! JUST WITH NEGATIVE MARGINS ???
for stacking same as Flex Layout, COPY FLEX LAYOUT

```html
<div id="grid">
  <div id="A">A</div>
  <div id="B">B</div>
  <div id="C">C</div>
  <div id="D">D</div>
  <div id="E">E</div>
</div>
```

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
}

#grid div {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  color: white;
  font-size: 10rem;
}

/* Grid layout */

#grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
}

#A {
  grid-column: 1 / span 2;
  grid-row: 2;
  align-self: end;
  background-color: deepskyblue;
  margin-top: 10vh;
  height: 40vh;
}

#B {
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 1;
  z-index: -1;
  background-color: purple;
}

#C {
  grid-column: 2;
  grid-row: 1;
  align-self: start;
  margin-left: -20px;
  background-color: orange;
  height: 70%;
}
#D {
  grid-column: 2;
  grid-row: 2;
  justify-self: end;
  align-self: start;
  background-color: lightgreen;
  height: 70%;
  width: 70%;
}
#E {
  grid-column: 1 / span 2;
  grid-row: 1 / span 2;
/*   z-index: 5; */
  justify-self: center;
  align-self: center;
  background-color: tomato;
  height: 50%;
  width: 50%;
}
```


## Grid placement

- beware: affects only visual rendering, keyboard navigation and screen reader still use document tree order ‚ùóÔ∏è


## Flex Layout comparison

two dimensional
alignment of content in both dimensions
explicitly position items in the grid, i.e. can create "holes"
allows explicit overlapping of items

Although many layouts can be expressed with either Grid or Flexbox, they each have their specialties. Grid enforces 2-dimensional alignment, uses a top-down approach to layout, allows explicit overlapping of items, and has more powerful spanning capabilities. Flexbox focuses on space distribution within an axis, uses a simpler bottom-up approach to layout, can use a content-size‚Äìbased line-wrapping system to control its secondary axis, and relies on the underlying markup hierarchy to build more complex layouts. It is expected that both will be valuable and complementary tools for CSS authors.

columns / rows can use flexible sizing
