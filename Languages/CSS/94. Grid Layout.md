# Grid Layout

[TOC]


<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction

- a regular layout, for applications
- two-dimensional layout since uses grid, for one-dimensional layout see Flex Layout
- replaces Table Layout 🎉



## Terminology

grid line: horizontal or vertical line
grid: set of intersecting grid lines
grid track: space between two adjacent grid lines, defines column and rows of grid
grid cell: intersection of a row and a column
grid area: rectangular set of adjacent grid cells



## Defining the Grid

grid consists of explicit and implicit grid tracks
final grid may end up larger due to grid items placed outside the explicit grid, in this case implicit tracks will be created

author can specify size of grid track

The size of the explicit grid is determined by the larger of the number of rows/columns defined by grid-template-areas and the number of rows/columns sized by grid-template-rows/grid-template-columns. Any rows/columns defined by grid-template-areas but not sized by grid-template-rows/grid-template-columns take their size from the grid-auto-rows/grid-auto-columns properties. If these properties don’t define any explicit tracks the explicit grid still contains one grid line in each axis

columns run along the block axis
rows run along the inline axis




## Grid track SIZE

track sizes can be fixed, flexible, or content-based
Each grid track is assigned a sizing function, which controls how it may grow


### Explicit grid tracks

grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas 

specifies the track list for the grid’s columns / grid’s rows

- `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`
- not inherited
- applies only to grid containers
- relative to logical inline / block directions instead of physical directions, see Writing Mode
- values: `none`, `<track-list>`, `<auto-track-list>`
- initial value: `none`
percentages refers to corresponding dimension of the content area

 track list is space-separated
 track list consists of line names and track sizing functions ???


 #### Shorthand

grid-template shorthand to set explicit grid properties (grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas)
grid shorthand to set explicit and implicit grid properties


### Implicit grid tracks

grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns properties

- `grid-auto-columns`, `grid-auto-rows`
- not inherited
- applies only to grid containers
- relative to logical inline / block directions instead of physical directions, see Writing Mode
- values: `<track-size>`{1,}
- initial value: `auto`
percentages refers to corresponding dimension of the content area



## Grid placement

grid item is placed into a grid area

Numeric indexes in the grid-placement properties count from the edges of the explicit grid. Positive indexes count from the start side (starting from 1 for the start-most explicit line), while negative indexes count from the end side (starting from -1 for the end-most explicit line).

grid line can be referred to by numerical index, or by an author-specified name
Grid area can be named explicitly or referenced implicitly by its bounding grid lines


by default automatically placed in order of source document ?!?!?! NO, BY ORDER PROPERTY, FALL BACK TO SOURCE
??? one item per cell ???
if item has size specified bigger than area can overflow

- beware: affects only visual rendering, keyboard navigation and screen reader still use document tree order ❗️
beware: affects only visual rendering, keyboard navigation and screen reader still use document tree order ❗️

can position multiple grid items in grid area ?? STACKING ORDER ?? VISUAL ORDER ??
???COPYFROMFLEXBOX beware: doesn't affect stacking order since doesn't change order of boxes but only the directions, see Visual order ❗️



## Size

let's grid determine size from placement, different than Flow Layout where specifies size on item

containing block of grid item is grid area its placed in

- beware: minimum size `auto` value of grid item that is not a scroll container, spans at least one track in that axis whose min track sizing function is auto, and spans more than one track in that axis of which none are flexible, then it resolves to `min-content` (with some adjustments) instead of zero ⚠️

### `auto` size

depends on self-alignment values




## Visual order

like in Flex Layout
affects auto-placement, see grid-auto-flow
affects painting order



## Gutters

empty grid tracks between other grid tracks
spaces grid tracks from each other

by default grid tracks are packed tightly
can use gap properties to make appear as separate 

can only specify for all rows / columns, not for individual ones
need to use margins of grid item instead



## Flex Layout comparison

two dimensional
alignment of content in both dimensions
explicitly position items in the grid, i.e. can create "holes"
allows explicit overlapping of items

Although many layouts can be expressed with either Grid or Flexbox, they each have their specialties. Grid enforces 2-dimensional alignment, uses a top-down approach to layout, allows explicit overlapping of items, and has more powerful spanning capabilities. Flexbox focuses on space distribution within an axis, uses a simpler bottom-up approach to layout, can use a content-size–based line-wrapping system to control its secondary axis, and relies on the underlying markup hierarchy to build more complex layouts. It is expected that both will be valuable and complementary tools for CSS authors.

columns / rows can use flexible sizing

sizes grid tracks and lets item size automatically grow to fill, instead of specifying item size ??

can't change direction of grid, uses writing mode, not needed since grid itself provides any directions
??? also when laying out automatically 

SAME:

order property
margins, auto margins
