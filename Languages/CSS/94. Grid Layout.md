# Grid Layout

[TOC]


<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction

- a regular layout, for applications
- two-dimensional layout since uses grid, for one-dimensional layout see Flex Layout
- replaces Table Layout üéâ

-----

## Grid

a set of intersecting grid lines
creates columns and rows

beware: affects only visual rendering, keyboard navigation and screen reader still use document tree order ‚ùóÔ∏è

### Grid line

- horizontal or vertical line

can be referred to by numerical index, or by an author-specified name

### Grid track

- space between two adjacent grid lines
- creates column and rows

columns run along the block axis
rows run along the inline axis

track sizes can be fixed, flexible, or content-based
by default grid tracks are packed tightly, can use gap properties to separate 

### Grid cell

intersection of a row and a column

### Grid area

set of adjacent grid cells that form a rectangle
can be named explicitly or referenced implicitly by its bounding grid lines
used to position grid item in grid
  can place grid items into any grid area

can position multiple grid items in grid area ?? STACKING ORDER ?? VISUAL ORDER ??
???COPYFROMFLEXBOX beware: doesn't affect stacking order since doesn't change order of boxes but only the directions, see Visual order ‚ùóÔ∏è



## Grid track SIZE

can be specified explicitly or implicitly
final grid may end up larger due to grid items placed outside the explicit grid, in this case implicit tracks will be created

### Explicit grid tracks

specifies the track list for the grid‚Äôs columns / grid‚Äôs rows

- `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`
- not inherited
- applies only to grid containers
- relative to logical inline / block directions instead of physical directions, see Writing Mode
- values: `none`, `<track-list>`, `<auto-track-list>`
- initial value: `none`
percentages refers to corresponding dimension of the content area

 track list is space-separated
 track list consists of line names and track sizing functions ???


 #### Shorthand




### Implicit grid tracks

grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns properties

- `grid-auto-columns`, `grid-auto-rows`
- not inherited
- applies only to grid containers
- relative to logical inline / block directions instead of physical directions, see Writing Mode
- values: `<track-size>`{1,}
- initial value: `auto`
percentages refers to corresponding dimension of the content area



## Grid placement

by default automatically placed in order of source document ?!?!?! NO, BY ORDER PROPERTY, FALL BACK TO SOURCE

- beware: affects only visual rendering, keyboard navigation and screen reader still use document tree order ‚ùóÔ∏è



## Size

let's grid determine size from placement, different than Flow Layout where specifies size on item

containing block of grid item is grid area its placed in

- beware: minimum size `auto` value of grid item that is not a scroll container, spans at least one track in that axis whose min track sizing function is auto, and spans more than one track in that axis of which none are flexible, then it resolves to `min-content` (with some adjustments) instead of zero ‚ö†Ô∏è

### `auto` size

depends on self-alignment values




## Visual order

like in Flex Layout
affects auto-placement, see grid-auto-flow
affects painting order






## Flex Layout comparison

two dimensional
alignment of content in both dimensions
explicitly position items in the grid, i.e. can create "holes"
allows explicit overlapping of items

Although many layouts can be expressed with either Grid or Flexbox, they each have their specialties. Grid enforces 2-dimensional alignment, uses a top-down approach to layout, allows explicit overlapping of items, and has more powerful spanning capabilities. Flexbox focuses on space distribution within an axis, uses a simpler bottom-up approach to layout, can use a content-size‚Äìbased line-wrapping system to control its secondary axis, and relies on the underlying markup hierarchy to build more complex layouts. It is expected that both will be valuable and complementary tools for CSS authors.

columns / rows can use flexible sizing

sizes grid tracks and lets item size automatically grow to fill, instead of specifying item size ??

can't change direction of grid, uses writing mode, not needed since grid itself provides any directions
??? also when laying out automatically 

SAME:

order property
margins, auto margins
