## Size

<!-- TODO: finish, see css-sizing-3 -->

size of box refers to total visible area it takes up, i.e. content area + padding + border but not margin !!

automatic sizing

- size: measure of magnitude in all dimensions, i.e. width and height of a 2-dimensional box
- beware: don't confuse with `block-size` and `inline-size`, bad naming choice for a one-dimensional length ⚠️
- inner size: size of content box
- outer size: size of margin box

size properties: width, height, min-width, min-height, max-width, max-height, and column-width
box-sizing property
- beware: not all boxes accept a custom size, only out-of-flow?? ones

standard box model using element's box-sizing: content-box (default)
- width / height of the box refers to width / height of content area, also min-width /height, max-widht/height
i.e. for "size" of box with border needs to add each padding and each border

- alternate box model using element's box-sizing: border-box, padding-box, margin-box ???
can make width height apply to different area of box e.g. border box
size of box often depends on the element’s content and/or its containing block size
The sizing properties, together with various other properties that control layout, define the size of the content area

padding, border, margin affect size of box, therefore may affect layout, e.g. line break

??? box-sizing selects to which width and height apply, content box, padding box, border box, margin box ?!?!

beware: `width` and `height` are always horizontal and vertical, but change their meaning for vertical writing mode

? but not smaller than content ???
by default as big as content, if not sized, if sized can be bigger or smaller, if smaller has overflow???

beware: don't use manual sizing if possible, let layout handle it

<!-- beware from old layout -->
inner box is entirely inclusive its margin in content area of outer box
outer box resizes to fit content, but if fixed size then content can overflow, may show scrollbar, see Overflow

content area depends on several factors like width / height property, if box contains other elements etc.
margin box width / height = content width / height + paddings + borders + margins
width of element can either be content, padding, border or margin box, by default content, often changed to border-box

`box-sizing`: specifies how size of element is calculated
	`content-box` (default, size includes only content), `border-box` (size includes content, padding and border, i.e. shrinks content box)

can be visualised in browser developer tools
beware: don't set border to visualize box, adds to size of box, affects layout


beware: use max(), min() functions with width / height instead of min-/max-width/-height ???


<!-- from MDN -->

by default size so that at least fits content, intrinsic size, natural size
can be bigger, e.g. block

can disable "auto sizing" by giving specific size, extrinsic size
may be sized smaller than content, content overflows
doesn't adapt anymore to content size, e.g. when resizing viewport
-> very careful with fixing size, content may overflow
??don't confuse with replaced content, e.g. image, has no content, is itself the content, different than other elements which contain something, e.g. text

properties: width and height, inline-size and block-size, min-/max-"
usually?? percentage of the width of the parent container. ?? or containing block
??percentage refers to _width_ of containing block, beware: even for `height` properties ❗️
??min-* is safe as doesn't prevent growing, rest unsafe, since prevents growing ?? max-width of images scales down !!

by default size of content-area, can use box-sizing to specify for padding-area?? or border-area instead, not for margin-area since margin collapse interferes

notes:
always specify size for images, otherwise are full size and don't scale ??
always use max-width since allows image to not be upscaled  when container grows bigger than it is


by default, width: 100% for block box, height: auto???
by default, width: auto for inline box, height: 1lh???
