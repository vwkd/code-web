# Overflow

[TOC]


<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction

- overflow if document is larger than viewport
- user agent offers scrolling mechanism for overflow area

???overflow-x controls line box width??? or containing block width???

- beware: vertical scrolling is more natural than horizontal scrolling ❗️

beware: any scrolling is always due to overflow ❗️

box with overflow can be scrolled, can scroll overflow into view
scrollport: padding box of scroll container, can think of as viewport
  nearest scrollport is scrollport of nearest ancestor scroll container
!!!!! beware: padding box includes padding, e.g. stickily positioned elements is not affected by padding ❗️
!!!!! beware: scroll container doesn't need to have actualy overflow and be scrollable, just have `overflow` other than `visible` ❗️


beware: can think of text like inline-level boxes for each word, wrap around to next line in block direction, overflow easily in block end, but in inline end only where a word is longer than whole inline size and not hyphenated ❗️


- beware: content of non-replaced element can overflow, content of replaced element not because "part of element", e.g. images ❗️

- "horizontal" overflow applies to inline direction, "vertical" overflow applies to block direction


<!-- beware: OLD, incorporate, then delete -->
- `overflow`: control behavior if content doesn’t fit in element’s box
- only applies to block elements with a specified size
- `visible` (default, not clipped), `hidden` (clipped and hidden), `scroll` (clipped, scroll bars), `auto` (clipped, scroll bars when needed)
- `overflow-x` / `-y`: the above just in horizontal / vertical direction
