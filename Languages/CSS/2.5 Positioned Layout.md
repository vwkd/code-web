# Positioned Layout

[TOC]



## Containing block

??only important for Positioned Layout

- rectangle with respect to which a box is sized and laid out / positioned
- derived from dimensions of a box, except for initial containing block ???

??? - principal box that establishes the current formatting context

- beware: a box is not confined by its containing block, can overflow ❗️
- initial containing block: containing block of the root element

<!-- ToDo: move to layout
e.g. inline box’s containing block is the content box of its closest block container ancestor;

if that block container is an in-flow block, then its containing block is formed by its parent block container;

if that grandparent block container is absolutely positioned, then its containing block is the padding edges of its closest positioned ancestor (not necessarily its parent)

and so on up to the initial containing block.


e.g. inline box’s containing block is the content box of its closest block container ancestor
absolutely positioned boxes containing block is the padding edges of its closest positioned ancestor
 -->

- beware: don't confuse content of box with boxes that have it as containing block, descendant boxes in box tree seem like content of box, but content can't overflow its box while a box can overflow its containing block



##

absolutely positioned elements establish new block formatting contexts for their contents
