# Web Workers API

[TOC]



## Introduction

<!-- ToDo: Finish -->

- separate thread, has own stack, queue, event loop, etc.
- intended for heavy pure computations to not block main thread
- can't access DOM, Event Listeners, etc.
- ‚ùìcan't communicates with main thread
- multiple web workers are at least on one separate thread, no guarantee that multiple threads, otherwise could overload browser easily


<!-- service workers: -->

can use as client-side proxy server, intercept network requests from client, respond with cache, etc.
used to build offline functionality

`self` refers to global scope of web worker ??
needs to use instead of just , because by default any code is NOT run in global scope ???
in future can use `globalThis` instead everywhere
