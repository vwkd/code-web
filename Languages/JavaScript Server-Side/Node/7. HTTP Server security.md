## Security

- need to open incoming port of HTTP server in firewall of network !!!

don't expose sensible information by accessing some route, e.g. unauthorised read, write, delete,

Never trust your users: every user could be hijacked, needs to check every data that comes to server, no exceptions ⚠️


- escape potentially dangerous characters
- limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary
- sandbox uploaded files

- don't expose any API that can be misused, e.g. list of all usernames
- don't send data in response that you don't want to expose, e.g. through HTTP proxy can read whole traffic
- prevent cross-site scripting attacks
  - URL escape untrusted content, e.g. appending search query to page, could put JavaScript in search query which is then executed and steals cookies

- set proper response ?? headers:
  - CSP to limit resources from own page, no inline-scripts, etc.
  - HSTS

- redirect HTTP to HTTPS with 301
use TLS i.e. HTTPS

best to only serve over HTTPS
set secure bit on cookie, such that it isn't transmitted over HTTP
set Strict Transport Security header
-> since TLS is application layer, everything below is still readable, e.g. TCP header, IP header like address, etc.

- encrypting HTTP is good, but data can still leak through DNS queries, if user doesn't use DNS over TLS

- set X-Frame-Options to restrict Iframes
- CSP

limit API calls to frequency, to trusted clients, etc.

## Logins

- store only hash, never save password itself
- upon login the password is transmitted, hashed, compared to stored hash, then access is (not) granted
- set time out after 3 consecutive logins to hinder bruteforce attacks
- implement password strength restrictions
- transmit login form via HTTPS, also page that serves login form, otherwise can manipulate `action` attribute on form element
- Make password reset form not tell if user is registered or not
- Make request with invalid user take same time as for valid user, so can't tell by time delay if user is valid, i.e. still hash password
- encrypt also other private data, need to store private key safely



- implement 2FA to protect agains user error

- handle all user input as dangerous
- protect against any integer overflow caused by user input
