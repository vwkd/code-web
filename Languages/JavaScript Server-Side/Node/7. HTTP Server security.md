# HTTP Server security

[TOC]

<!-- ToDo: Finish -->


## Introduction

- also general security practices



## HTTPS Server

- normal HTTP server
- interfaces with underlying TLS implementation
- needs to provide certificate for identification
- use 301 redirect from HTTP to HTTPS version
- don't use HTTP, except if whole world is allowed to know, e.g. data in reponse
- most of the below doesn't help without HTTPS, since data can be manipulated in transit ❗️



## Response headers

- CSP to limit resources from own page, no inline-scripts, etc.
- `Strict-Transport-Security` to mandate HTTPS
- `X-Frame-Options` to disable website being loaded in iframe, e.g. on malicious copy
secure bit on cookie, such that it isn't transmitted over HTTP



## Routes

- don't expose sensible information or side effects on unauthorised routes, e.g. read, write, delete
- don't expose any API that can be misused, e.g. list of all usernames
- limit API call frequency, e.g. on input pages like login, to trusted clients, etc.



## User input

- "never trust your users", all user input is dangerous ⚠️
- sanitise any data in body or in URL query, escape potentially dangerous characters, e.g. XSS attack, could put JavaScript in search query which is then executed and steals cookies
- sandbox uploaded files
- protect against integer overflow caused by input



## External resources

- passive content: can't interact with page, e.g. images
- don't allow passive content where tracking is unwanted
- active content: can interact with rest of page, e.g. script, AJAX
- don't allow active content where taking over entire page is unwanted
- use hash integrity verification on script tags
- load every resource over HTTPS, no mixed content



## Sensitive data

- input form with HTTPS action, also surrounding page HTTPS to prevent manipulation of form action attribute data
- use sandboxed iframe for sensitive input, e.g. payment data, login
- use third-party login / payment system, e.g. via Amazon
- don't use active content on page with sensitive data



## Login

- transmit password over HTTP, hash on server, compare to stored hash
- store only hash, never password itself, in case of breach
- implement password strength restrictions
- password reset form shouldn't tell if user is registered or not
- response time of invalid login and valid login should take same time, can't tell if user is in-/valid, i.e. hash password even if invalid
- implement 2FA to protect against user compromise
- limit API calls to limit bruteforce attacks



## Database

- encrypt private data, need to store key safely
