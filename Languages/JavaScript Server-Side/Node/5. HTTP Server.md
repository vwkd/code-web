# HTTP Server

[TOC]

<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction

Never trust your users: every user could be hijacked, needs to check every data that comes to server, no exceptions ⚠️


- handle request from client and send appropriate response
- figure out what content goes in response  
  how to present it is task of client, e.g. styles, scripts
- use frameworks to not build everything from scratch, e.g. HTTP server

- is basically just abstraction of complex if statements, if headers, method, body, etc. because request and response are just text files
server is basically a complex series of if statements to figure out what to do for any given request

## Tasks

- build response, headers, body, etc. e.g. content-type, content-length, etc.

correct content-type
load correct file, e.g. `index.html` if `/`, else `404.html`, etc.
correct status codes

- interact with database, e.g. input validation, database-provider independent methods
- template documents 

routing URLs to appropriate handlers, interacting with databases, supporting sessions and user authorization, formatting output (e.g. HTML, JSON, XML), and improving security against web attacks


- map URLs for different resources to specific handler functions
- validate requests and data
- operate database to store data
- build response from template and database ??


## Routers


- can change URL without changing underlying code in handler function

## Security

- escape potentially dangerous characters
- limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary
- sandbox uploaded files

- don't expose any API that can be misused, e.g. list of all usernames
- don't send data in response that you don't want to expose, e.g. through HTTP proxy can read whole traffic
- prevent cross-site scripting attacks
  - URL escape untrusted content, e.g. appending search query to page, could put JavaScript in search query which is then executed and steals cookies

- set proper response ?? headers:
  - CSP to limit resources from own page, no inline-scripts, etc.
  - HSTS

- redirect HTTP to HTTPS with 301
use TLS i.e. HTTPS

best to only serve over HTTPS
set secure bit on cookie, such that it isn't transmitted over HTTP
set Strict Transport Security header
-> since TLS is application layer, everything below is still readable, e.g. TCP header, IP header like address, etc.

- encrypting HTTP is good, but data can still leak through DNS queries, if user doesn't use DNS over TLS

## Logins

- store only hash, never save password itself
- upon login the password is transmitted, hashed, compared to stored hash, then access is (not) granted
- set time out after 3 consecutive logins to hinder bruteforce attacks
- implement password strength restrictions
- transmit login form via HTTPS, also page that serves login form, otherwise can manipulate `action` attribute on form element
- Make password reset form not tell if user is registered or not
- Make request with invalid user take same time as for valid user, so can't tell by time delay if user is valid, i.e. still hash password
- encrypt also other private data, need to store private key safely



- implement 2FA to protect agains user error

- handle all user input as dangerous
- protect against any integer overflow caused by user input

## Server-side web frameworks





## HTTP Server

- middleware (function): function in the request / response processing pipeline, e.g. handle database access
- the next middleware function is commonly denoted as `next`






- need to open incoming port of HTTP server in firewall of network !!!
