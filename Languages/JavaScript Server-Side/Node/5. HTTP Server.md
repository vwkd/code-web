# HTTP Server

[TOC]



## Introduction

- handle requests from client and send appropriate responses
- basically a complex series of if statements to figure out what to do for any given request



## Tasks

### Basic

- parse request headers, e.g. accepted content type, compression, etc.
- parse request body, e.g. form data, etc.
- perform input validation, e.g. escape HTML, etc.
- build response from local files (static server), e.g. `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, etc.
- choose different response based on file path and method (routing), e.g. `index.html` for `/`, else `404.html`, etc.
- set response status code, e.g. `200 OK` or `404 Not Found` etc.
- set response headers, e.g. content type, content length, compression, etc.
- error handling and logging
- support state-of-the-art HTTP protocols, e.g. `Connection: keep-alive` header
- support security headers, e.g. ???
- etc. pp.

### Advanced 

- build response dynamically from templates
- keep session state, e.g. using cookies
- connect to database, validate input
- handle login authorisation
- etc. pp.



## Web framework

- abstracts away the underlying HTTP server to build a `TCP` connection, e.g. `http` module in Node
- exposes an API to declaratively handle requests and responses
- facilitates the tasks above as much as possible
- almost always want to use a web framework, e.g. Express, Koa (used here), etc.  

```javascript
const Koa = require('koa');
const app = new Koa();
const PORT = 3000;

app.use(async ctx => {
  ctx.body = 'Hello World';
});

// sugar for http.createServer(app.callback()).listen(...) from http module
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on ${PORT}...`);
});
```

```plaintext
GET http://localhost:3000/ HTTP/1.1
```

```plaintext
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

Hello World!
```
