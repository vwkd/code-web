# Asynchrony


<!-- todo: finish -->



## RE

<!-- todo: below redundant? Already said "scripting language for the browser" -->
- RE is Web browser
<!-- todo: below is redundant -->
- native program on the OS, can have multiple threads and processes
- runs a JS engine on a single thread, "main thread"
- provides access to different threads through Web APIs
- depends on implementation if threads in same or different processes, e.g. different processes in Chrome
- beware: JS is not only synchronous, see Promises ❗️
- beware: Web APIs aren't all asynchronous, see DOM API and BOM API ❗️

<!-- todo: correct below, MOSTLY -->
- RE runs Web APIs in separate thread(s) to not block main thread



## Code

calls Web API
if doesn't come back with result, good, needs nothing more, e.g. `console.log("Hello World")`
if comes back with a result, wants to tell it in JS what to do with it, ! needs to execute JS !
writes some JS that is given the result, how exactly see later
this JS is run only after the current JS is done, can think of current JS running top-to-bottom without stopping, because otherwise would be non-deterministic
can think like current JS leaves behind a letter in an envelop, is opened only long after it has died
confusingly writes both in same linear text file, intermingled, esp with async await, can't scan top-to-bottom anymore to know what is run when

after current JS is done, runs the handler JS on the main thread, as the results come in
RE puts callbacks into a queue, tells engine to execute in series
different queues for different APIs, with different semantics
  RE decides in which order they are called
  some are called until empty, some are called only once

since Web APIs don't all come back before script is done, or may come back multiple times (Event API), needs a loop that runs endlessly -> EVENT LOOP

beware: don't confuse order of code to order how things are run on main thread

note, remember JS is a script to control the RE itself, RE specifies what every line of code of JS does, because it itself runs it, it itself translates it to machine code on the CPU
  it can say run this code now and run that code later
  therefore it can schedule the execution of functions (callbacks to a Web API) for later, writes callbacks in a queue

## Queues

<!-- todo: find better term for "script", since is everything -->
<!-- todo: clarify results = callbacks -->

- problem: how gets resulting data from separate thread back into main thread?
- script in main thread, calls out to separate threads, queues results in a queue (if any)
first script runs in main thread, top-to-bottom, RE creates separate threads for any calls to Web APIs, runs threads "in parallel" (see Terminology how threads might run concurrent in single CPU cores or parallel in multiple CPU cores) 
- after script is done, continues with results from queue in main thread

## Event Loop

orchestrates how to get results from other threads back onto main thread
- problem: JavaScript execution isn't linear anymore, not just start and done, creates side effects and reacts to side effects, e.g. events
- RE loops eternally, calls one item from queue, (in browser) DOM (e.g. Parse HTML / Style calc / layout / paint), etc., "event loop"
beware: only one item from queue before layout / rendering as needed
- if any callback takes too long, "blocks", e.g. in browser page freezes

after main is done, calls all items from microtask queue, then one from any macrotask queue of choice, (in browser) then render step / DOM stuff if necessary
  which task queue to pick in each loop is choice of browser, e.g. prioritize mouse click before setTimeout

loop: all microtask, one macrotask, all EXISTING rAF, render
microtask are always executed (even mid macrotask), fully until empty, even newly added ones
beware: endless loop in microtask queue blocks since is run until completion!!!

beware: can have thousands of tasks between renderings, e.g. setTimeout(callback, 0) runs in (almost, not really) every event loop, more often than requestAnimationFrame(callback) every now and then when renders, more inefficient, also in background, etc. !!!
debounce frequent tasks using rAF
beware: rAF runs right before rendering step, not right after it !!!

beware: Event initiated through user or through JS can have different results, if callback queues in microtask queue, because in latter has JS on the stack

each task gets run from start to finish, isn't interrupted, can't be interrupted

<!-- todo: consider using the term Stack, as Philip Roberts in his talk
event loop takes callback from queue, pushes it onto the stack of the main thread to run it
 -->

<!-- todo: old, incorporate -->
- -> since browser styling, layout, rendering run on main thread as well, expensive JS function blocks code and makes page freeze

## Language

- problem: how writes "parallel" code in a linear text file?
see CPS, Promises, Async await

note, async code is separate, can't merge back code paths, not like a path that splits and merges
beware: can't use from async operation ever again, just tells what to do later, script itself ended already !!!!
beware: doesn't bring code paths "together"

- response is either ignored or collected in a "mailbox" to be used after it's done

- can think of code running top-to-bottom without stopping
<!-- todo: above true? really? what about functions -->
<!-- todo: really? what about JSON -->

////////////////////////////////// old

runtime system contains
  engine which makes call stack, heap, etc.
  queues
  event loop to glue it together

- -> call to Browser API immediately completes from call stack, gets executed in seperate thread, call stack can continue

### Task / Callback queue (of main thread)

- queue for callbacks from Browser API calls that returned, to get executed on main thread
- there can be multiple queues depending on runtime, e.g. in browser
  - macrotask queue: callbacks from `setTimeout`, `XHRHttpRequest`, Event Listeners, etc.
  - rendering pipeline: styling layout, repaint of page
  - microtask queue: callbacks from promises, Mutation Observer, etc.
  - own queues: `IndexedDB`, `requestAnimationFrame`, etc.
- browser schedules rendering intelligently only when needed, i.e. adapts to screen refresh rate, usually every ~16 ms (≙ 60 FPS)

### Event loop (of main thread)

- loops over task queues, executes callbacks on main thread
- only when call stack is empty / clear
- -> callback gets immediately executed once on call stack since call stack is clear by requirement
- -> _any_ async code must wait till _all_ sync code is done / stack is clear
- -> `setTimeout(callback, 0)` is like adding to bottom of stack
<!-- todo: above true? how would explain difference to new Promise.resolve().then(callback)? Better don't use analogy of skipping queues... -->
- -> `setTimeout` waiting time is only _minimum time_, needs to account for waiting time in task queue as well
- -> "run to completion": any callback will run to completion, can't be stopped in middle to run another one, unlike in C++
- -> no race of threads, e.g. a click event handler is executed to completion before any repaint can happen, i.e. no flashing while changing DOM
- priority of task queues per loop:
  1. _one_ macrotask is executed, very first is script itself ⚠️
  2. _all_ microtasks are run, until microtask queue is empty, including ones that are added while running
  3. if repaint is needed, _all_ rAF callbacks are run, only currently queued, not one that are added while running
  4. if repaint is needed, _one_ rendering from rendering pipeline is run
- -> rAF is efficient, runs only together with repaint, adapts to screen refresh rate and only when visible, while `setTimeout` doesn't adapt at all, always runs, runs too often, etc.
- -> since all rAF callbacks are run, must nest rAF twice to schedule change for next instead of current render ❗️
- ---> event loop must run fast to be non-blocking, either split expensive code in multiple async parts, e.g. with `setTimeout(fn, 0)`, so browser can schedule repaints in between callbacks when needed, since they are on the macrotask and run only once per event loop, or if purely computational task use entirely seperate thread, e.g. using Web Workers
- -> beware: events can behave differently when triggered normally or artificially in JS, because via page the call stack is initially clear, while via JS the triggering itself is a function on the stack, can make task queues wait till stack is clear ⚠️
- -> beware: one large macrotask or many small microtasks can block stack, browser can't render, page freezes

## Implementation

- usually just-in-time compiled, first parsed (catches static errors like syntax, builds scope, etc.), then executed
- modern runtimes use Mark-and-sweep garbage collection, old ones used Reference-counting garbage collection
