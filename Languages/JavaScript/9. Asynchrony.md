## Introduction

- concurrent asynchronous operations and synchronous operations

- JS allows concurrently asynchronous operations apart from synchronous operations
- beware: JS (without Web APIs) operations are not only synchronous, e.g. Promises are asynchronous ❗️
- beware: Web API operations aren't all asynchronous, e.g. DOM API and BOM API are synchronous ❗️



## Operations

<!-- todo: improve definition -->

script
- outer "main" operation is synchronous
- main operation can contain asynchronous operations, which can further contain async ops, etc.
- main operation is only synchronous one, any further operations are asynchronous


- 
- script can contain multiple asynchronous operations
- main operation can contain nested async operations
- for async operation specifies handler function that runs with results
<!-- todo: handler function receives result from Web API (if any) as argument -->
- operations are executed independently, order can be non-deterministic, see Implementation

- always remain separate code paths
- beware: can't merge code paths again since async is only run after sync is done ⚠



- for language constructs, see CPS, Promises, Async await
- problem: how can write code that runs "parallel" in a linear text? Would need multiple dimensions, but has only single dimension.


## Concurrency order

- outer sync operation runs start-to-end, schedules any nested async operations
- nested async operations run after sync is done, runs nested sync operation start-to-end, schedules any nested async operations
- repeats with nested async operations
- order of async operations depend on type:
  - first *all* microtasks, e.g. Promises, MutationObserver API, etc.
  - then *one* macrotask, e.g. Timeout API, Fetch API, Event API, etc.
- beware: order of nested async operations get confusing really quickly ❗️
- beware: order of code isn't order of execution, can't read code top-to-bottom to know what is run when ⚠️

```javascript
// operations example
// running order: op_main, op_2, op_21, op_1, op_211, op_11, op_111

{//op_main: sync
  {//op_1: async macrotask
    {//op_11: async macrotask
      {//op_111: async microtask
      }
    }
  }
  {//op_2: async microtask
    {//op_21: async microtask
      {//op_211: async macrotask
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// real example for above operations
// running order: op, op2, op21, op1, op211, op11, op111

setTimeout(() => {

  setTimeout(() => {

    Promise.resolve().then(() => {
      console.log("op111");
    })

    console.log("op11");
  }, 0)

  console.log("op1");
}, 0)

Promise.resolve().then(() => {

  Promise.resolve().then(() => {

    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("op211");
    }, 0)

    console.log("op21");
  })

  console.log("op2");
})

console.log("op");
```



## Implementation

- cooperative multitasking
- JS runs on single thread, "main thread"
- many Web APIs run on separate thread, don't block main thread
- depends on implementation if threads in same or different processes, e.g. different processes in Chrome
- Web browser uses same main thread to create DOM, e.g. parse HTML, style calc, layout, paint, etc.

### Event Loop

- eternal loop in RE that schedules JS execution in the JS engine
- runs handlers from queues until completion
- one handler can run at a time, isn't interrupted
- handler can create more handlers
- beware: a long running handler blocks the thread, because event loop can't continue ⚠️
- one iteration is called a "tick"
- 

- beware: a long queue takes long, e.g. `setTimeout(() => {}, 0)` with 20 items in the queue will wait some time until is run ⚠️
- beware: a endless Microtask queue blocks as well, since the event loop can't continue ⚠️

"main script" runs first, calls async code with handlers, async code puts into queue
after main script finishes, event loop runs handlers from queues
loops eternally if they create new handlers
beware: each script runs start-to-end without stopping, (see event loop runs only when call stack is empty)


JS is still non-deterministic, often doesn't know which order two async operations run in
  but more deterministic than interleaving threads on OS level
"race condition" if has two async operations that access and modify the same shared state, source of bugs, e.g. access and modify the shared DOM, etc.

don't make assumptions about async operation order, e.g. two subsequent `setTimeout(..., 0)` calls may or may not be in order

handlers share same state because in same scope

<!-- todo: rework below, make sub-chapter of Implementation -->
<!-- todo: many Web APIs don't need separate thread, e.g. Timeout API just puts into queue, only needs threads for actual tasks, e.g. network, storage, etc. -->

## Call out, come back
<!-- todo: find better term for "script", since is everything -->

- a JS script runs start-to-end on main thread
- schedules any asynchronous operations, e.g. call out to a Web API in separate thread, create Promise, etc.
- result is either ignored or collected in a "mailbox" to be used after script is done
- after finishes, runs handler with results from asynchronous operations on main thread
- for each handler these steps are repeated as if it was itself a script
synchronous run first, schedule asynchronous, after sync is done runs async

- beware: handler may be called multiple times, e.g. Event API ❗️

- beware: don't confuse asynchrony with Web API threads, Web API threads can run in parallel on multi-core CPU, while handlers can only run concurrently on single thread ❗️

## Order of handler

- uses queues to schedule handlers
- queues run in a predefined order
- for some queues runs only one handler, some queues are emptied from the current handler, some queues are emptied for even new handlers
...

- microtask queues for Promise handler, MutationObserver API handler
- macrotask queues for Web API handler
- depends on implementation what order the subqueues run
- microtask queue is run until empty BEFORE LOOPING ??
- macrotask queue is run only once BEFORE LOOPING ??


### 

orchestrates how to get results from other threads back onto main thread

- problem: JavaScript execution isn't linear anymore, not just start and done, creates side effects and reacts to side effects, e.g. events
- RE loops eternally, calls one item from queue, (in browser) DOM (e.g. Parse HTML / Style calc / layout / paint), etc., "event loop"
beware: only one item from queue before layout / rendering as needed
- if any callback takes too long, "blocks", e.g. in browser page freezes

after main is done, calls all items from microtask queue, then one from any macrotask queue of choice, (in browser) then render step / DOM stuff if necessary
  which task queue to pick in each loop is choice of browser, e.g. prioritize mouse click before setTimeout

loop: all microtask, one macrotask, all EXISTING rAF, render
microtask are always executed (even mid macrotask), fully until empty, even newly added ones
beware: endless loop in microtask queue blocks since is run until completion!!!

beware: can have thousands of tasks between renderings, e.g. setTimeout(callback, 0) runs in (almost, not really) every event loop, more often than requestAnimationFrame(callback) every now and then when renders, more inefficient, also in background, etc. !!!
debounce frequent tasks using rAF
beware: rAF runs right before rendering step, not right after it !!!

beware: Event initiated through user or through JS can have different results, if callback queues in microtask queue, because in latter has JS on the stack

each task gets run from start to finish, isn't interrupted, can't be interrupted

<!-- todo: consider using the term Stack, as Philip Roberts in his talk
event loop takes callback from queue, pushes it onto the stack of the main thread to run it
 -->

<!-- todo: old, incorporate -->
- -> since browser styling, layout, rendering run on main thread as well, expensive JS function blocks code and makes page freeze









////////////////////////////////// old

runtime environment contains
  engine which makes call stack, heap, etc.
  queues
  event loop to glue it together

- -> call to Browser API immediately completes from call stack, gets executed in seperate thread, call stack can continue

### Task / Callback queue (of main thread)

- queue for callbacks from Browser API calls that returned, to get executed on main thread
- there can be multiple queues depending on runtime, e.g. in browser
  - macrotask queue: callbacks from `setTimeout`, `XHRHttpRequest`, Event Listeners, etc.
  - rendering pipeline: styling layout, repaint of page
  - microtask queue: callbacks from promises, Mutation Observer, etc.
  - own queues: `IndexedDB`, `requestAnimationFrame`, etc.
- browser schedules rendering intelligently only when needed, i.e. adapts to screen refresh rate, usually every ~16 ms (≙ 60 FPS)

### Event loop (of main thread)

- loops over task queues, executes callbacks on main thread
- only when call stack is empty / clear
- -> callback gets immediately executed once on call stack since call stack is clear by requirement
- -> _any_ async code must wait till _all_ sync code is done / stack is clear
- -> `setTimeout(callback, 0)` is like adding to bottom of stack
<!-- todo: above true? how would explain difference to new Promise.resolve().then(callback)? Better don't use analogy of skipping queues... -->
- -> `setTimeout` waiting time is only _minimum time_, needs to account for waiting time in task queue as well
- -> "run to completion": any callback will run to completion, can't be stopped in middle to run another one, unlike in C++
- -> no race of threads, e.g. a click event handler is executed to completion before any repaint can happen, i.e. no flashing while changing DOM
- priority of task queues per loop:
  1. _one_ macrotask is executed, very first is script itself ⚠️
  2. _all_ microtasks are run, until microtask queue is empty, including ones that are added while running
  3. if repaint is needed, _all_ rAF callbacks are run, only currently queued, not one that are added while running
  4. if repaint is needed, _one_ rendering from rendering pipeline is run
- -> rAF is efficient, runs only together with repaint, adapts to screen refresh rate and only when visible, while `setTimeout` doesn't adapt at all, always runs, runs too often, etc.
- -> since all rAF callbacks are run, must nest rAF twice to schedule change for next instead of current render ❗️
- ---> event loop must run fast to be non-blocking, either split expensive code in multiple async parts, e.g. with `setTimeout(fn, 0)`, so browser can schedule repaints in between callbacks when needed, since they are on the macrotask and run only once per event loop, or if purely computational task use entirely seperate thread, e.g. using Web Workers
- -> beware: events can behave differently when triggered normally or artificially in JS, because via page the call stack is initially clear, while via JS the triggering itself is a function on the stack, can make task queues wait till stack is clear ⚠️
- -> beware: one large macrotask or many small microtasks can block stack, browser can't render, page freezes
