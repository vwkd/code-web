- scripting language
- almost every computer has a JS interpreter - the browser - which makes JS one of the most popular programming languages in the world

- initially developed for the Web browser, nowadays also for the server (desktop OS)
- runtime system is browser, nowadays also Deno (or Node)

- part of a Web page, controls behavior of Web page, or rather Web browser how it shows it
can think of JS as changing behavior of RS, scripting language, changes behavior of RS, an like the steering wheel to drive a car

- JS itself can't have side effects, purely computational, like in a sealed box
- wants to have side effects, interact with computer, e.g. log to console, use network, (in browser) manipulate Web page, etc.
- RS provides Web APIs, allow side effects, e.g. BOM API, Fetch API, DOM API, Events API, etc.



## Features

- dynamic typing, prototype-based inheritance, first-class functions



## ECMAScript (ES)

- standard of language
- "JavaScript" is trademark of Oracle, has no relation with Java except historic name to attract popularity

| ES[year]        | [year]    |

- feature gap: gap of current ES version to ES version supported by runtime system
- use transpiler to bridge feature gap, supporting old runtime system shouldn't come at the expense of the developer, developer needs to be able to use contemporary features
