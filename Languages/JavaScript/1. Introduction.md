## Introduction

- scripting language for the Web browser
- one of the most popular programming language in the world, almost every computer has a JavaScript runtime system (Web browser)
- beware: nowadays can also use on server, for desktop OS itself, like a modern shell, e.g. Deno, Node, etc. ❗️
- Web APIs provided by RS to have side effects, e.g. log to console, use network, (in browser) manipulate Web page, etc.
- part of a Web page, sandboxed to that page



## ECMAScript (ES)

- standard of language
- doesn't contain Web APIs, doesn't have any side effects
- "JavaScript" is trademark of Oracle, has no relation with Java except historic name to attract popularity
- dynamic typing, prototype-based inheritance, first-class functions

- feature gap: gap of current ES version to ES version supported by runtime system
- use transpiler to bridge feature gap, supporting old runtime system shouldn't come at the expense of the developer, developer needs to be able to use contemporary features
