# JavaScript




- runtime system is browser, nowadays also Deno (or Node)
- almost every computer has a JS interpreter - the browser - which makes JS one of the most popular programming languages in the world

- modern runtimes use Mark-and-sweep garbage collection, old ones used Reference-counting garbage collection


## Introduction

- just-in-time compiled multi-paradigm scripting language  
  like other languages compiled, first parsed (catches static errors like syntax, builds scope, etc.), then executed
- dynamic typing, prototype-based inheritance, first-class functions
- client-side JS runs in browser, uses Browser APIs  
  control behavior of Web pages, neither structure nor appearance
- server-side JS runs in runtime environment, e.g. Node.js  
  control server
- standard language is called ECMAScript (ES), "JavaScript" is trademark of Oracle, has no relation with Java except historic name to attract popularity
<!-- todo: explain JavaScript = ECMAScript + Web APIs  -->
- file extension .js

- feature gap: gap of current ES version to ES version supported by runtimes
- use transpiler to bridge feature gap, supporting old runtimes shouldn't come at the expense of the developer, developer needs to be able to use contemporary features
