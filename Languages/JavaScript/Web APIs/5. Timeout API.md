# Timeout API

## Introduction

- API for ???



## `setTimeout()`

`WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope.setTimeout(callback, delay)`

- executes callback once after a delay of delay ms, simple timer
- returns unique identifier, integer
- if timer has not yet elapsed can cancel using `clearTimeout(timeoutID)` (or `clearInterval(timeoutID)` since `setInterval()` shares the same ID pool)  
  beware: an invalid ID does not throw an error ❗️
- `this` inside callback will be back to default (global object / undefined in non- / strict mode) since callback is passed as argument to another function, can preserve it by wrapping _value of callback_ in anonymous function❗️

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {callback()}, delay)
```

- the delay is actually only the minimum wait time, because the task queue needs to wait until the call stack is clear before the callback can be executed (see Runtime)
- for animation use `requestAnimationFrame()`, and `setInterval()` for constant timed calls
- nested `setTimeout` calls are throttled by browser, in foreground maximal every 4 ms, in background maximal every 1s



## `setInterval()`

`WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope.setInterval(callback, delay)`

- executes callback repeatedly every delay ms, simple loop
- returns unique identifier, integer
- if timer has not yet elapsed can cancel using `clearInterval(timeoutID)` (or `clearTimeout(timeoutID)` since `setTimeout()` shares the same ID pool)  
  beware: an invalid ID does not throw an error ❗️
- `this` inside callback will be back to default (global object / undefined in non- / strict mode) since callback is passed as argument to another function, can preserve it by wrapping _value of callback_ in anonymous function❗️

```javascript
setInterval(() => {callback()}, delay)
```

- the delay is actually only the minimum wait time, because the task queue needs to wait until the call stack is clear before the callback can be executed (see Runtime)
- interval does not adjust to how long code takes to run, i.e. if code runs longer than delay, next call is run even before previous returned
- use `setInterval` to guarantee constant delay between consecutive call starts, while recursive `setTimeout` to guarantee constant delay between previous call end and next call start

```javascript
(function constantGap() {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // your code here
    constantGap();
  }, delay);
})();
```

- `setInterval` calls are throttled by browser, in foreground maximal every 4 ms, in background maximal every 1s



## `requestAnimationFrame()`

`window.requestAnimationFrame(callback)`

- executes callback once together with next repaint of screen, no custom delay
- returns unique identifier, integer
- if browser has not yet repainted, can cancel using `window.cancelAnimationFrame(requestID)`
- callback is passed number of milliseconds since time origin as argument, is usually time at which browser context was created
- not available in Web Workers, unlike `setTimeout`/`Interval()`
- to make interval needs to call recursively

```javascript
let requestID;

function draw() {
  // your code here
  requestID = requestAnimationFrame(draw);
}

// can stop animation with cancelAnimationFrame(requestID) or build logic in recursion to not call itself anymore
```

- rAF runs a function repeatedly as quickly and efficiently as possible on given system, since browser intelligently adapts repaint to device, e.g. frame rate not higher than maximal screen refresh rate, no repaint if page is not visible, etc.
- only use `setInterval()` / recursive `setTimeout()` if needs specific framerate
