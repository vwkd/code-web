## Introduction

- separate instance of JS engine
- can think of like another page in background, but without the page stuff
- can communicate with original page through Event API
- separate from original page, no access, e.g. resources, DOM, etc.
- access to some Web APIs, e.g. fetch, etc.
- implementation puts on another thread, allows to run JS "in parallel"
- beware: threads depend on implementation, no guarantees that multiple Web Workers have actually multiple threads, could overload RE ❗️
- use for pure computations to not block main thread



## Service Worker

- client-side proxy server, between webpage and network, before browser cache
- can intercept any network request from webpage, e.g. custom cache, prefetch often needed resources in background, etc.
- can use to build offline functionality, push notifications, background sync, etc.

can bypass / update cache using Fetch API and `cache` property of options

`self` refers to global scope of web worker ??
needs to use instead of just , because by default any code is NOT run in global scope ???
in future can use `globalThis` instead everywhere
