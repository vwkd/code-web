# Web Workers API

[TOC]


<!-- ToDo: Finish -->

## Introduction

- separate thread, has own stack, queue, event loop, etc.
- intended for heavy pure computations to not block main thread
- can't access DOM, Event Listeners, etc.
- ‚ùìcan't communicates with main thread
- multiple web workers are at least on one separate thread, no guarantee that multiple threads, otherwise could overload browser easily



## Service Worker

- client-side proxy server, between webpage and network, before browser cache
- can intercept any network request from webpage, e.g. custom cache, prefetch often needed resources in background, etc.
- can use to build offline functionality, push notifications, background sync, etc.

can bypass / update cache using Fetch API and `cache` property of options

`self` refers to global scope of web worker ??
needs to use instead of just , because by default any code is NOT run in global scope ???
in future can use `globalThis` instead everywhere
