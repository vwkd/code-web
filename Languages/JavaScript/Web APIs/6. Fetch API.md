# Fetch API

[TOC]



## Introduction

(see also beforehand The Web)

<!-- ToDo: Finish -->

- HTTP client, can send requests and receive responses
- successor to XMLHttpRequest API
XMLHttpRequest using Promises



## AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript + XML)

- architectural style of web applications that dynamically update content asynchronously
- instead of loading whole new page for every small update, fetches and updates only what changes, e.g. search engine fetches only new results and appends them to page, same for maps, social media, etc.
- name contains XML because data was transmitted in text format XML, today is transmitted in JSON
- makes use of Fetch API, CSS, DOM, etc., name should actually be "Asynchronous JavaScript + CSS + DOM + Fetch API"
- today is standard way of creating web pages, but back in 2005 was totally new approach, therefore got its own name
- AJAX engine: implementation of AJAX, e.g. the function that fetches and updates the changes



## Abort

using AbortController

```javascript
const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;

setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 5000);

fetch(url, { signal }).then(response => {
  return response.text();
}).then(text => {
  console.log(text);
}).catch(err => {
  if (err.name === 'AbortError') {
    console.log('Fetch aborted');
  } else {
    console.error('Uh oh, an error!', err);
  }
});
```

A single signal can be used to abort many fetches at once



## Request

`fetch(url, options)`

object ??

### Mode

only requests of that type will resolve ???

### Method

string

### Headers

object

### Body

string

### Credentials

```javascript
fetch(url, {
  credentials: 'include'
})
```



## Response

Stream object

Canâ€™t access Set-Cookie header of response due to security !!!

### Type

???
where the resource has come from and can be used to inform how you should treat the response object
resource on the same origin has `basic` type, no restrictions on what you can view from the response
resource on another origin which returns the CORS headers then the type is `cors`. Like basis type, except restricts the headers you can view to `Cache-Control`, `Content-Language`, `Content-Type`, `Expires`, `Last-Modified`, and `Pragma`
resource on another origin which doesn't return CORS headers then the type is `opaque`. won't be able to read the data returned or view the status of the request

### Status

check status
??? what is a good response ???
DEPENDS ON INDIVIDUAL ENDPOINT, NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT RESPONSE CAN BE, E.G. CAN ONLY BE 200 OR ALSO 201, ETC.

```javascript
response.status == 200
```

```javascript
response.status >= 200 && response.status < 300
```

also no universal specification how error messages should be transmitted, e.g. if JSON then in `message` property of object
needs to be adapted to service always !!



## CORS

for security browser allow only requests from the page only to the same domain where the page is hosted
can circumvent that restriction using Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
sets Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in response by service ???
???protects only endpoint, not client

beware: only restricted in browsers, could still hit endpoint from custom client



## Examples

```javascript
try {
    const response = await fetch("https://icanhazdadjoke.com", {
      headers: { Accept: "application/json" }
    });
    if (!response.ok) {
      // NOT res.status >= 200 && res.status < 300
      return { statusCode: response.status, body: response.statusText };
    }
    const data = await response.json();

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({ msg: data.joke })
    };
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err); // output to netlify function log
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ msg: err.message }) // Could be a custom message or object i.e. JSON.stringify(err)
    };
  }
```
