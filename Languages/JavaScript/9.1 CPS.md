# Continuation Pasing Style (CPS)



## Introduction

- passes handler as callback argument
- convention is to use first argument of callback for errors

```javascript
function callback(error, data) {
  ...
}

asyncOperation(..., callback);
```



## Disadvantages

- misuses callbacks as control flow, conflates input and output, gives input to handle output
- nested async calls are messy, "callback hell"
- no guarantees, e.g. how callback is called, if it's called, how often it's called, etc.
- can't throw errors, because would yield back into API
- needs to handle errors, can't ignore, not automatically passed up the call stack until someone handles it
- can't return, because would yield back into API
- looses call stack
