# Continuation Pasing Style (CPS)



## Introduction

- use callbacks as control flow



- function passed to Web API
- subsequential Web API calls are nested, messy, "callback hell"
bad control flow, because within function scope ??
needs to handle errors at every step, not automatically passed up the stack (?) until someone handles it, no error bubbling up the ? chain like in sync code
no call stack, no return, no throw
no guarantees, doesn't know if callback is called, how often it's called, with which arguments it's called, etc.

conflates input and output of API, gives input to handle output, input is control flow construct
no guarantees, how many handlers, how many argyments in a handler, how often a handler is called, if multiple handlers are called, etc.
hack, misues existing language for async operations
can't throw

- put all sync code relying on the async code in a callback function, and pass it as argument to the async function, which then calls the "callback" after its async operation has finished
- convention is to use first argument of callback function for any error
- callback function must include any error handling apart from success handling, often anonymous

```javascript
function asyncFunc(..., callback) {
  ...                      // async operation
  if (...) {               // on success
    callback(null, data);
  } else {                 // on error
    callback(error);
  }
}

asyncFunc(..., callbackFunc(error, data));
```

- problem: multiple consecutive asynchronous callbacks get messy, "callback hell", e.g. fetch image1, handle image1, upon success fetch image2, handle image2, etc.
