# Asynchronicity


<!-- todo: finish -->

## Introduction

- ECMAScript is purely computational, can't have any side effects, like in a sealed box
- RS runs script in single thread ("main thread"), i.e. script runs top-to-bottom without stopping
- RS wants to have side effects, interact with computer, e.g. log to a console, use the network, (in browser) manipulate the Web page, etc.
- RS provides Web APIs, allows side effects, e.g. BOM API, Fetch API, DOM API, Events API, etc.
- RS runs Web APIs in separate thread to not block main thread, all Web APIs are async


```javascript
// thread diagram:             main   second
const a = 1;                //  |
                            //  |
console.log("Hello World")  //  |        |
                            //  |        |
const b = 1;                //  |        |
                            //           ‚ãÆ
                            //           |
```

```javascript
// thread diagram:     main   second
const a = 1;        //  |
                    //  |
setTimeout(() => {  //  |       |
  const b = 1       //  |       |
}, 100);            //  |       |
                    //  |       |
const c = 1;        //  |       |
                    //          ‚ãÆ
                    //          |
                    //  |
```


## Queues

<!-- todo: find better term for "script", since is everything -->
<!-- todo: clarify results = callbacks -->

- problem: how gets resulting data from separate thread back into main thread?
- script in main thread, calls out to separate threads, queues results in a queue (if any)
first script runs in main thread, top-to-bottom, RS creates separate threads for any calls to Web APIs, runs threads "in parallel" (see Terminology how threads might run concurrent in single CPU cores or parallel in multiple CPU cores) 
- after script is done, continues with results from queue in main thread

queues are created as wanted, e.g. each API has its own queue
queues get called in order (FIFO)

## Event Loop

orchestrates how to get results from other threads back onto main thread
- problem: JavaScript execution isn't linear anymore, not just start and done, creates side effects and reacts to side effects, e.g. events
- RS loops eternally, calls one item from queue, (in browser) DOM (e.g. Parse HTML / Style calc / layout / paint), etc., "event loop"
beware: only one item from queue before layout / rendering as needed
- if any callback takes too long, "blocks", e.g. in browser page freezes

after main is done, calls all items from microtask queue, then one from any macrotask queue of choice, (in browser) then render step / DOM stuff if necessary
  which task queue to pick in each loop is choice of browser, e.g. prioritize mouse click before setTimeout

loop: all microtask, one macrotask, all EXISTING rAF, render
microtask are always executed (even mid macrotask), fully until empty, even newly added ones
beware: endless loop in microtask queue blocks since is run until completion!!!

beware: can have thousands of tasks between renderings, e.g. setTimeout(callback, 0) runs in (almost, not really) every event loop, more often than requestAnimationFrame(callback) every now and then when renders, more inefficient, also in background, etc. !!!
debounce frequent tasks using rAF
beware: rAF runs right before rendering step, not right after it !!!

beware: Event initiated through user or through JS can have different results, if callback queues in microtask queue, because in latter has JS on the stack

each task gets run from start to finish, isn't interrupted, can't be interrupted

<!-- todo: consider using the term Stack, as Philip Roberts in his talk
event loop takes callback from queue, pushes it onto the stack of the main thread to run it
 -->



## Language

- problem: how writes "parallel" code in a linear text file?

### Callback

- function passed to Web API
- subsequential Web API calls are nested, messy, "callback hell"

### Promise

- object returned by Web API
- method to register callback, returns itself a promise, subsequential Web API calls are chained instead of nested üéâ
- method to register error callback, "skips" rest of chain automatically, first-class error handling üéâ
- chained functions have separate scopes, can't access variables from within different callbacks easily, needs to pass value along

- different queue, WHY?

### Async await

- sugar syntax for promises
- has same scope, can access variables from different callbacks easily üéâ
- has try... catch again, original error handling üéâ
- looks like code stops, jumps out?? to next outer?? await and continues there
- beware: doesn't actually stop ‚ùóÔ∏è

## Call stack (of main thread)
<!-- todo: move partly to Terminology -->

- stack of active functions
- push when called, pop after returned
- "stack overflow" when stack exceeds available memory, e.g. with infinite (non-tail) recursion
- dev tools show "stack trace" of functions when error happens
- -> JS runs only on call stack of main thread
- -> call to Browser API immediately completes from call stack, gets executed in seperate thread, call stack can continue



### Task / Callback queue (of main thread)

- queue for callbacks from Browser API calls that returned, to get executed on main thread
- there can be multiple queues depending on runtime, e.g. in browser
  - macrotask queue: callbacks from `setTimeout`, `XHRHttpRequest`, Event Listeners, etc.
  - rendering pipeline: styling layout, repaint of page
  - microtask queue: callbacks attached to promises, or from Mutation Observer
  - own queues: `IndexedDB`, `requestAnimationFrame`, etc.
- browser schedules rendering intelligently only when needed, i.e. adapts to screen refresh rate, usually every ~16 ms (‚âô60 FPS)



### Event loop (of main thread)

- loops over task queues, executes callbacks on main thread
- only when call stack is empty / clear
- -> callback gets immediately executed once on call stack since it's clear by requirement
- -> _any_ async code must wait till _all_ sync code is done / stack is clear
- -> `setTimeout(callback, 0)` is like adding to bottom of stack
- -> `setTimeout` waiting time is only _minimum time_, needs to account for waiting time in task queue as well
- -> "run to completion": any callback will run to completion, can't be stopped in middle to run another one, unlike in C++
- -> no race of threads, e.g. a click event handler is executed to completion before any repaint can happen, i.e. no flashing while changing DOM
- priority of task queues per loop:
  1. _one_ macrotask is executed, very first is script itself ‚ö†Ô∏è
  2. _all_ microtasks are run, until microtask queue is empty, including ones that are added while running
  3. if repaint is needed, _all_ rAF callbacks are run, only currently queued, not one that are added while running
  4. if repaint is needed, _one_ rendering from rendering pipeline is run
- -> rAF is efficient, runs only together with repaint, adapts to screen refresh rate and only when visible, while `setTimeout` doesn't adapt at all, always runs, runs too often, etc.
- -> since all rAF callbacks are run, must nest rAF twice to schedule change for next instead of current render ‚ùóÔ∏è
- ---> event loop must run fast to be non-blocking, either split expensive code in multiple async parts, e.g. with `setTimeout(fn, 0)`, so browser can schedule repaints in between callbacks when needed, since they are on the macrotask and run only once per event loop, or if purely computational task use entirely seperate thread, e.g. using Web Workers
- -> beware: events can behave differently when triggered normally or artificially in JS, because via page the call stack is initially clear, while via JS the triggering itself is a function on the stack, can make task queues wait till stack is clear ‚ö†Ô∏è
- -> beware: one large macrotask or many small microtasks can block stack, browser can't render, page freezes

## (A)Synchronicity

### Synchronous operations

- one can't start until the previous has completed, "blocking"
- dependent on each other
- i.e. single thread on single core

### Asynchronous operations

- one can start before the previous has completed, "non-blocking"
- independent of each other
- parallel: multiple operations are executed at same time, really parallel, i.e. multiple threads on multiple cores
- concurrent: multiple operations are executed in same time frame by intelligently switching between them, seemingly parallel, i.e. multiple threads on single core
- -> JS itself is single-threaded, runs on "main thread" of runtime
- -> since JS is single-threaded it is "blocking", synchronous
- -> but runtime environment - browser - provides access to more threads via Browser APIs, e.g. `setTimeout`, `XHRHttpRequest`, Event Listeners, etc. enables concurrency via event loop, "asynchronous operation"
- -> since browser styling, layout, rendering run on main thread as well, expensive JS function blocks code and makes page freeze
