## Async await



<!-- todo: move async function from 8. Iterators and Generators to here -->

## Introduction

- sugar syntax for promises (with ES2017)
- has same scope, can access variables from different callbacks easily 🎉
- has try... catch again, original error handling 🎉
- looks like code stops, jumps out?? to next outer?? await and continues there
- beware: doesn't actually stop ❗️
