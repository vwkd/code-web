# Elements

[TOC]



## Introduction

- elements are used to add meaning to content
- use semantic elements as often as possible



## Element categories

Block-level elements:
- single per line in parent element
- parent can only be other block (except anchor ???)

Inline elements:
- multiple per line in parent element
- parent can be block or inline element

--> CSS property can show them, but doesn't change element category, i.e. div can not inside span



## Meta elements

| name | description |
| - | - |
| `<html>` | root element of document |
| `<head>` | container for meta data of document |
| `<body>` | container for visible content of document |
| `<title>` | title, for browser tab, favorites, search engines |
| `<style>` | styles, by default assumes CSS |
| `<script>` | scripts, by default assumes JavaScript |
| `<link>` | links external resources to document, empty element |
| `<meta>` | specifies meta data of document, empty element, e.g. `charset`, `refresh rate`, `width` for browsers, `author`, `description`, `keywords` (not used by Google anymore) for search engines |
| `<base>` | set the base URL for all relative URLs in doc |

- `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` are optional in HTML5, if omitted are inferred from structure
- It's indeed paradoxical to declare the encoding of a file inside of itself. It's only a fallback if the HTTP `Content-Type` header is missing. Since most browsers by default read using an ASCII compatible encoding, one hopes that the file encoding is ASCII compatible and that there are only ASCII characters until this meta statement at the beginning of the file.



## Structure elements

- used to group content, can then use CSS to style or layout, or JS to add dynamic behavior
- use groups only for styling sparingly, instead use CSS inheritance
- use semantic elements if possible, e.g. `<header>` instead of `<div id="header">`, „divitis“ is overuse of `<div>` elements for everything

| name | description |
| - | - |
| `<main>` | main content of the document, only once |
| `<header>` | header for the document or a section |
| `<footer>` | footer for the document or a section |
| `<nav>` | container for navigation links |
| `<section>` | related part of page, single functionality |
| `<article>` | independent self-contained content |
| `<aside>` | content aside from main content, e.g. sidebar |
| `<figure>` | dependent self-contained content with independent position, `<figcaption>` for caption, e.g. code block, illustration |
| `<details>` | additional details, can view or hide, `<summary>` for heading |
| `<mark>` | highlighted text |
| `<time>` | human-readable date/time |
| `<div>` | block-level element, non-semantic, avoid if possible |
| `<span>` | inline-level element, non-semantic, avoid if possible |



## Formatting elements

- formatting elements are used to format content, not style (see CSS instead!)

| element | description |
| - | - |
| `<strong>` | strong text, like `<b>` but with semantic meaning |
| `<em>` | emphasised text, like `<i>` but with semantic meaning |
| `<ins>` | inserted text, like `<u>` but with semantic meaning |
| `<del>` | deleted text, like `<s>` but with semantic meaning |
| `<mark>` | highlighted text |
| `<small>` | smaller text |
| `<sub>` | subscripted text |
| `<sup>` | superscripted text |
| `<q>` | inline quotation, quotation marks |
| `<blockquote>` | blockquote quotation, indented, attributes: `<cite>` for source |
| `<abbr>` | abbreviation |
| `<address>` | address, italic with line breaks |
| `<cite>` | citation, italic |
| `<bdo>` | bidirectional text overwrite, text direction, attributes: `dir = "rtl", "ltr"` |
| `<pre>` | preformatted text, preservces spaces and line breaks |



## Presentational elements

- presentational elements are used to style content
- don't use, use CSS instead!
