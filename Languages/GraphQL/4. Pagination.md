# Pagination

[TOC]



## Introduction

- splitting list into chunks
- beware: "page" is historical term where chunks were used for book-like pages, think Google
- allows client to fetch only part of list, resume where left off
- assume sorted list, list adds / deletes items only at ends, e.g. sorted by creation date of item
- beware: can not add / delete data in middle of list, otherwise duplicate / skipped chunks ❗️



## Offset

- offset from beginning (or end) of list

```graphql
{
  users(first: 2, offset: 2) {
    name
  }
}
```

- problem: can only add data to opposite end of list from which offset, otherwise duplicate / skipped chunks
- use if list adds / deletes items only to / from opposite end of offset, never other end or middle



## Cursor

- pointer to item in list
- uses unique property of item that doesn't change, e.g. `id` field
- make cursor opaque to not leak implementation details, otherwise can't change in future, e.g. base64 encode of `id` field

```graphql
# beware: not functional yet, read further
{
  users(first: 2, after: $userCursor) {
    name
  }
}
```

- needs to communicate cursor, can't be field of list object since meta property of connection
- introduce intermediate layer of "connection object", cursor in `pageInfo` object with last page flag
- connection can have metadata fields, e.g. `totalCount` of connections

```graphql
{
  usersConnection(first: 2, after: $userCursor) {
    totalCount
    users {
        name
    }
    pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
    }
}
```

- want cursor for every, such that can continue paging through list from anywhere in chunk instead from only end
- introduce second intermediate layer of list of edges, each edge has own cursor
- edge can have metadata fields, e.g. date `since` edge exists

```graphql
{
  usersConnection(first: 2, after: $userCursor) {
    totalCount
    edges {
        node {
          name
        }
        cursor
        since
    }
    pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
    }
}
```

- can still provide list object on connection object as convenience for when doesn't need cursor or metadata about edge

```graphql
{
  usersConnection(first: 2, after: $userCursor) {
    totalCount
    edges {
        node {
          name
        }
        cursor
        since
    }
    users {
        name
    }
    pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
    }
}
```

```graphql
type Query {
  usersConnection(
    first: Int,
    last: Int,
    after: String,
    before: String
  ): UsersConnection
}

type UsersConnection {
  totalCount: Int
  edges: [UsersEdge]
  users: [User]
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

type UsersEdge {
  node: User
  cursor: String!
  since: Date
}
```

- beware: could also name `users` what here is `usersConnection` and `nodes` what here is `users`, e.g. GitHub ❗️
