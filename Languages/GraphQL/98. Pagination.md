[TOC]


usually field of list type

list may grow too large to consume everything
client may not consume everything, wants to continue where left off
needs cursor to continue where left off

but first needs to define where new data is added to list, e.g. only at end
if data is also added in middle, cursor is useless...?!?!
?!?! depends on use case
