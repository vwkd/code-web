# Auth

[TOC]



## Introduction


## Authentication

- see HTTP API
- pass session / user information down to below layers in context object
beware: don't do it in resolver, should not need to know about it

### Private API

- before API, e.g. in middleware before API middleware
full control over who makes API calls, easy rate limiting

### Public API with private parts

- in API as first step, before resolver, e.g. in context function
pass through resolver to underlying business logic for authentication
??wrap resolver functions in authenticated and authorised wrappers



## Authorization

after resolver
requires Authentication, otherwise has no user

beware: don't do it in resolver, should not need to know about it
create Business Logic Layer, between resolver and database
contains validation, authorization, error handling
pass full user object instead of opaque token to business logic layer
