# Introduction

## GraphQL

- API query language and IDL
- API query language is designed for JSON responses
- IDL makes documentation first-class, e.g. via introspection



## Document

- string that contains definitions
- most general unit, doesn't need to contain executable operation or complete schema
- beware: here assume that document contains either executable operation(s) or single complete schema ❗️

### Grammar

- white space, line terminators, commas are not significant, only stylistic, e.g. argument list, array, etc.
- comments are lines starting with `#`
- beware: comments are different than in JS, not `//` ❗️
- names can consist of `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` but not start with a digit
- names are case sensitive
- lists are unordered, e.g. argument list, selection list, etc.



## Request / Response

- server runs GraphQL engine that can execute operations
- client sends request to server with document containing executable operation(s), variables, and name of operations to run (if document contains more than one operation)
- server returns response with data as JSON
