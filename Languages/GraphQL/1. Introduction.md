# Introduction

## GraphQL

- API query language and IDL
- API query language is designed for JSON responses
- IDL makes documentation first-class, e.g. via introspection



## Document

- string that contains definitions

```plaintext
Document:
   ExecutableDefinition+
   TypeSystemDefinition TypeSystemExtension*

ExecutableDefinition:
    OperationDefinition
    FragmentDefinition
```

- beware: differs from spec, spec allows for partial documents and mixes of query language and IDL, here assume document contains either executable operations or single schema, see [#788](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/788#issuecomment-721298885) ⚠️



### Grammar

- white space, line terminators, commas are not significant, only stylistic, e.g. argument list, array, etc.
- comments are lines starting with `#`
- beware: comments are different than in JS, not `//` ❗️
- names can consist of `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` but not start with a digit
- names are case sensitive
- lists are unordered, e.g. argument list, selection list, etc.



## Request / Response

- server runs GraphQL engine that can execute operations
- client builds string of document containing executable operation(s), sends request to server along with variables and name of operations to run (if document contains more than one operation)
- server verifies operation against schema, runs resolver functions, returns response with data as JSON
??? - by convention data is under `data` key in JSON object, `error` key for errors, ... ?



## Errors

<!--
??? if query errors gets partial response by default, needs to do error handling on client

??? error list
field is set to `null` value + error is added to list
error never just makes field `null` without other information
if error and field type is non-null, then field error is thrown ?? parent field is set to null ??

allows a nullable field to return null if it fails, e.g. server down, typo in name, etc.
if error on non-nullable field, bubbles up until nearest nullable parent type and nulls that

doesn't use HTTP verbs!!!, e.g. if query failed still 200 OK (except if server itself has problem)
