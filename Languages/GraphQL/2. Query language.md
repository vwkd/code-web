## Language

### Grammar

White space, like terminators, and commas are stylistic, not significant
Comments with #
Unintuitive, should have been // like in JS

Names consist of letters digits and underscore, but must not start with digit
[a-zA-Z0-9_]
case sensitive

Lists are unordered, e.g. Argument list, Selection list
Beware: comments are only stylistic, but help to read

### Operation

action that GraphQL performs
always returns data, even when writes, i.e. always needs only single request üéâ

shaped like data it returns

OperationType Name VariableDefinitions Directives SelectionSet ?!?!

Beware: terms don‚Äôt have any meaning outside of GraphQL request, see implementation how they map onto underlying data

#### OperationType

query: read data

mutation: write and read data

subscription: read data repeatedly without further operations

Shorthand for single operation, can leave out name

Shorthand for single query without variables & directives, can leave out name and type
I.e. single operation without type defaults to query

#### Selection

Field
FragmentSpread
InlineFragment

SelectionSet is list of one or more Selection in curly braces
{
  Selection
  Selection
}

#### Field

piece of data
Can think of as value ?!
Either scalar type or object type

??Maps onto a value in underlying data, but value may not even exist, can be patched together from multiple others...

Alias Name Arguments Directives SelectionSet

Can itself contain a selection set

Beware: field itself doesn‚Äôt know what type it is, needs to see type system to understand if scalar type or complex type!!!

Operation must specify selection down to fields of scalar type
?? Ensures unambiguously shaped response
response contains only the selected fields of the object type

?!?! If specifies a field a second time (without alias) is ignored

#### Argument

Filter for field

Name: Value

Arguments is list of one or more Argument in parentheses ( Argument Argument )
Beware: commas are optional, only syntactic

beware: don‚Äôt confuse argument with selection!

Beware: don‚Äôt confuse Argument with Field, e.g.

User(id: 4) {
	id
}

#### Field Alias

Key of field in response object
without alias defaults to field name

Needed to query [sic] same field multiple times, because object keys must be unique

### Fragment

// ToDo: Write first: What are types?

Reusable selection set to use in the place of a Field in Operation, see Selection

Must be a selection set, i.e. can not use for a Field that is of scalar type

Must specify type of Field it‚Äôs applied in
?? ANY ANCESTOR FIELD?!?!
if type doesn‚Äôt match, doesn‚Äôt return any value, as if not there
Fragment is applied conditionally if placed in a Field which can have multiple types, e.g. due to a union type

fragment FragmentName TypeCondition Directives SelectionSet

FragmentName is any Name except ‚Äúon‚Äù

TypeCondition: on NamedType

Used with spread syntax
FragmentSpread: ... FragmentName Directives

Can define fragments inline as well, used when wants to conditionally include fields
For inline fragments can omit TypeCondition, used when wants to conditionally include fields based on directive

Can use variables, given that uses fragment only in Operations where variable is defined

### Variable

can define variables for an operation
Can use for any non-constant Value, i.e. in Argument, or Directive
Defined like arguments to fields on name of operation, see Operation

Supplied with request, substituted by GraphQL service

VariableDefinition:
$ Name: Type Value Directives

VariableDefinitions is list of VariableDefinition in parentheses, e.g. (VariableDefinition VariableDefinition)

Type can be any type from the schema ??? Type system

### Directive

special instructions to engine
For Operation, Field (and Fragment), or Variable
  or in schema !!!
E.g. including/omitting a field conditionally based on its value

Individual to engine, must be defined and implemented by engine?!?!
Except @include(if: Boolean) and @skip(if: Boolean), see Implementation

Directive:
@ Name Arguments

Directives is list of Directive, without anything, e.g. no parentheses

order of directives is significant

///
### Input Values

Scalar, enum, list, object
Can be variable

Block string with triple ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù, but can‚Äôt use escaped characters in it, needs to use normal string!!!

In arrays commas are optional, repeated commas don‚Äôt represent missing values!!!

Array elements are ordered
object properties are unordered

Beware: don‚Äôt confuse arrays with lists, and objects with selection sets !!!
///

fields are always optional
inputs (e.g. field arguments, variables) are optional by default, required if has non‚Äênull input type (and may also not be `null`)
