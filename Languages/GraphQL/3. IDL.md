# IDL

[TOC]



## Introduction

uses type system FOR WHAT? REQUEST AND RESPONSE?
similar to TypeScript, e.g. object types, interface types, union types, etc.
beware: don't confuse IDL with query language, e.g. object fields and object field types



## Type System

Used to determine if a request is valid
    e.g. query field that doesn't exist
used to determine if value for variable is valid
    describe values returned by a field
used to generate documentation of API, capabilities of GraphQL service

beware: don't confuse query language with IDL, look similar, but are different things

TypeSystemDefinition:
    SchemaDefinition
    TypeDefinition
    DirectiveDefinition

beware: can't have multiple `TypeDefinition`s or `DirectiveDefinition`s in a `TypeSystemDefinition`, but can through multiple `Definition`s, doesn't make much sense logically but resulting document stays the same

### Type

can define arbitrary types
used in type system

name of type or field must be unique
must not start with two underscores __ since reserved for introspection system

TypeDefinition
    ScalarTypeDefinition
    ObjectTypeDefinition
    InterfaceTypeDefinition
    UnionTypeDefinition
    EnumTypeDefinition
    InputObjectTypeDefinition

by default a type is nullable and singular
use wrapping type to make nullable
all types are nullable, i.e. include `null`

input type: type for arguments and variables
output type: type for fields

#### Named types

type subsets: scalar and compound

##### Primitive types

??
can be used as both input types and output types

Scalar, primitive value, e.g. string, integer
ScalarTypeDefinition:
    Description scalar Name Directives

Enum, enumerable primitive value
    discrete set of possible values

null ?!?!

fields with primitive type are leaves in response tree

built-in scalar types: `Int`, `Float`, `String`, `Boolean`, and `ID`
can add own
?????When representing a GraphQL schema using the type system definition language, all built‚Äêin scalars must be omitted for brevity.

##### Complex types

??
can only be used as output types

Object
list of named fields, whose values are each another type
A field of an Object type can't be input object type!!!
??? FIELD DIFFERENT FROM QUERY LANGUAGE? USE PROPERTIES INSTEAD ??? BUT ALSO USES "OBJECT" ?!

ObjectTypeDefinition:
    Description type Name ImplementsInterfaces Directives FieldsDefinition
ImplementsInterfaces:
    implements & NamedType
    ImplementsInterfaces & NamedType
FieldsDefinition:
    {FieldDefinition_List}
FieldDefinition:
    Description Name ArgumentsDefinition : Type Directives

###### Field argument type

ArgumentsDefinition:
    (InputValueDefinition_List)
InputValueDefinition:
    Description Name : Type DefaultValue Directives

must be an input type (any type except an Object, Interface, or Union type)

--

fields with complex type are intermediate levels in response tree

--

??? DIFFERENCE TO INPUT OBJECT TYPE
Input Object types can only be used as input types

Input object
set of input fields
input fields are either scalars, enums, or other input objects

InputObjectTypeDefinition
    Description input Name Directives InputFieldsDefinition
InputFieldsDefinition:
    {InputValueDefinition_List}

beware: don't confuse with Object type, only used as input types
separate type from Object type, since doesn't allow field arguments, interface and union
beware: doesn't use `type` keyword, but still is a type

##### Abstract types

??
can only be used as output types

interface type
list of fields, represents a list of named fields and their arguments
object types & other interfaces can implement interfaces, which requires object type to define all fields defined by the interfaces
Whenever a field claims it will return an Interface type, it will return a valid implementing Object type during execution

InterfaceTypeDefinition:
    Description interface Name Directives FieldsDefinition

union type
list of possible Object types
beware: doesn't currently allow other types than Object types, see [#215](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/215)
whenever the type system claims a union will be returned, one of the possible types will be returned

UnionTypeDefinition:
    Description union Name Directives UnionMemberTypes
UnionMemberTypes:
    = | NamedType
    UnionMemberTypes | NamedType

beware: doesn't use `type` keyword, but still is a type
beware: must use fragments in operation because no fields defined on union

#### Wrapping types

wraps a type and returns a new type

`List`:
collection of items of given type
denoted with `[T]` for type `T`

`Non-Null`
type without `null`
beware: also error cannot result in null !!!
denoted with `T!` for type `T`

### Directive

???

name of directive must be unique
must not start with two underscores __ since reserved for introspection system

DirectiveDefinition:
    Description directive @ Name ArgumentsDefinition on DirectiveLocations

must not reference itself through ArgumentsDefinition, otherwise would be circular!!

built-in type system directive `@deprecated`, see Implementation
<!-- should be in introspection section, not part of IDL -->

### Description

Description: StringValue

can add descriptions in markdown immediately before any type, fields of a type, field arguments, and schema itself
showed on introspection
similar to JSDoc comments in TypeScript
no need to keep external manual in sync üéâ


### Schema

<!-- operation type or type of operation ??? -->

description of type system ?? definition of type system
uses types and directives
?? basically list of operations with types in curly braces and "schema" keyword

contains types of operations
types of operation must be object types
must set type of at least one query operation, any more operations are optional
    since GraphQL service must support querying, but not necessarily mutations or subscriptions
beware: two operations can't use same type??!! ?? ONLY NOT BETWEEN MUTATION AND QUERY, MAYBE BETWEEN SUBSCRIPTION AND QUERY???

SchemaDefinition:
    Description schema Directives { OperationTypeDefinition_List }
OperationTypeDefinition
    OperationType : NamedType
(beware: in spec called root operation type, but type has nothing special to root!!!)

```graphql
schema {
  query: MyQuery
  mutation: MyMutation
}

type MyQuery {
  myField: String
}

type MyMutation {
  setMyField(to: String): String
}
```

shorthand to omit schema, whose operation types are named like operation with first letter uppercase, e.g. `type Query {..}`
beware: with shorthand, can have at most one of each query, mutation and subscription operation and if misspells "Mutation" or "Subscription" then would be silently ignored, e.g.

```graphql
# Shorthand for `schema { query: Query, mutation: Mutation }`

type Query {
  myField: String
}

# Oops! GraphQL assumes `schema { query: Query }` since no "Mutation" type
type Lutation {
  setMyField(to: String): String
}
```

beware: also can't use "Mutation" or "Subscription" as name for any other type since would automatically be picked up as operation type
beware: avoid schema shorthand, be explicit!






## Type system extension

can have extension of type system, e.g. by local service
this might be used to represent local data
or by a GraphQL service which is itself an extension of another GraphQL service.

TypeSystemExtension:
    SchemaExtension
    TypeExtension

SchemaExtension: 
    extend schema Directives {OperationTypeDefinition_List}

TypeExtension
    ScalarTypeExtension
    ObjectTypeExtension
    InterfaceTypeExtension
    UnionTypeExtension
    EnumTypeExtension
    InputObjectTypeExtension
Object type extensions may choose not to add additional fields, instead only adding interfaces or directives.

beware: can't have multiple `SchemaExtension`s or `TypeExtension`s in a `TypeSystemExtension`, but can through multiple `Definition`s, doesn't make much sense logically but resulting document stays the same
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/788

## Implementation

Field: function that returns value, can take arguments
Argument: argument of Field function
beware: arguments must be unordered!!!
