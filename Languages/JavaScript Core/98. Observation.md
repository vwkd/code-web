### Observation

iteration: consumer pulls out multiple values from producer one at a time, consumer is in control, producer "waits" until consumer pulls new value, e.g. via iteration object, sync pull stream
observation: producer pushes multiple values to consumer one at a time, producer is in control, consumer "waits" until producer pushes new value, e.g. via event listener, sync push stream
  → observation ↔ iteration

async iteration: iteration, consumer pulls out promise and "waits" until resolves, pushes back value, consumer pulls next promise, async pull streams
async observation: iteration, consumer is pushed value, pushes back promise, producer "waits" until promise is resolved to push next value, producer pushes next value (i.e. handles backpressure), async push stream

What does async function * return ? should return observable ??


wait asynchronously on stream of values, e.g. Streams API (browser API)
