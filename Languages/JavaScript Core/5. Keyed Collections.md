## Keyed collections

[TOC]



## `Map` object type

```javascript
const mp = new Map([[key1, value1], [key2, value2]]);

const mp = new Map();
mp.set(key1, value1);
mp.set(key2, value2);
```

- collection of key-value pairs, like object, but with better features
- any data type as value and key, not only String or Symbol
- has size property
- iteration order is defined as insertion order of keys, (for objects is only since ES6)
- for...in loop gives [key, value] directly instead of just keys
- `NaN` is considered equal to itself, `+0` and `-0` are considered equal to each other
- can set properties using dot / bracket notation like for objects, but shouldn't be done to avoid confusion ❗️



## `WeakMap` object type

- `Map` object, but only objects as keys
- keys are weekly referenced, i.e. garbage collection isn't prevented incase there's no other reference to the object
- good to prevent memory leaking
- not enumerable, because garbage collection is not determined



## `Set` object type

```javascript
const st = new Set([1, 2, 3, 3, 3]);

const st = new Set();
st.add([1, 2, 3, 3, 3]);
```

- collection of values, like array
- values must be unique, duplicates get discarded, i.e. can make an array unique by converting to set and back ❗️
- has size property
- can delete elements by value, in array needs to splice
- search method `Set.prototype.has()` is faster than `Array.prototype.indexOf()` for arrays
- `NaN` is considered equal to itself, `+0` and `-0` are considered equal to each other



## `WeakSet` object type

- `Set` object, but "weak", like what `WeakMap` is to `Map`
