## TypeScript

- statically typed superset of JS
- elevated development experience with powerful tooling around static type-checking
- zero cost since syntax is otherwise equal to JS, "compiles away" to plain JS

### Types

- turns dynamically typed language back into statically typed language
- takes JS type system and writes it down, static formalisation of JS's dynamic type system
- enforces the subset of JS that makes sense, not the one that is syntactically valid
- but much more powerful types than in any other classical language
  - implicit inference hides a lot of typing
  - types are narrowed down based on control flow, type guards, assignments, etc.
  - conditional types, everything is a type
- doesn't force you to strongly type everything, no binary choice, can dial it up gradually, the more types the better checking
- can use types to build documentation, no need to annotate just for documentation, avoids extra layer of complexity and potential errors

### Tooling

- types is what allows for powerful tooling, because values have different functionality based on their types, e.g. control flow, function arguments, available methods (a `toString()` method but not necessarily a `toUpperCase()` method), etc.
- needs to restrict values so can reason about behavior during development
- powerful tooling, e.g. error checking, statement completion, safe refactoring, code navigation etc.
- tooling during development right when needs it, not only later when trying to run it
- no more unit test for every line of code, can sleep again well at night
- knows all the stuff the programmer is otherwise supposed to know by heart
- statement completion in context, only the semantically valid, not just all variables the scope has access to like in other IDEs

### Zero-cost

- removes types completely on compilation to JS
- no performance overhead since it all "compiles away", as if you had written JS in the first place (but without bugs)
- no extra code is injected, compiles away to plain JS
- just for error checking during development
- exact same runtime behavior and syntax, no translation, only layer on top
- type checking makes sense only during development anyways, on client during execution can not do anything, like a ship out on the sea, can not fix if it breaks down in production
- TS doesn't prevent compilation if there is a type related error, since is still valid JS
- beware if has API that others are going to use, security is gone as soon as compiled to JS, e.g. `readonly` properties, `private` class members ⚠️

### Superset

- technically it's own language, but follows exactly ECMAScript specs, doesn't diverge from standard, just adds static types
- like JavaScript with type annotations, no overhead in translating JS implementation into TS implementation
- implements new JS features when they reach Stage 3, can use newest features
- transpiles backwards for older ES versions, but better use only for types and use Babel for transpilation


## Implicit typing

- types get inferred where ever possible, e.g. in variable assignment, return type of function, etc.
- don't need to provide types for everything, but safer so can not later accidentally change them, and use them for documentation

```typescript
const age = 42;

age.toUpperCase(); // error since age is number and not string
```

- the declared type determines the types that are allowed to be assigned, even if in meantime had a more specific type

```typescript
let x = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 42 : "world";
    
x = 1;            
x = "goodbye!";
// both valid assignments since declared type was string | number
```


## Structural typing

- type compatibility is checked using duck typing ("If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck!")
- one type is compatible with another, as long as it implements _at least_ all properties of the other type

```typescript
interface Named {
  name: string;
}

function sayHi(obj: Named) {
  console.log(`Hi, my name is ${obj.name}.`);
}

// 'p' implements at least all properties of 'Named'
const p = { name: "Peter", age: 42 };
sayHi(p);
```

```typescript
interface Named {
  name: string;
}

class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

// 'Person' implements at least all properties of 'Named'
const q: Named = new Person("Peter", 42);
```

- excess property checking: object literals aren't allowed to have more properties than specified when assigning them directly to variables or passing them as arguments to functions, often source of bugs, can allow by assigning it to new variable with type inference and using that variable

```typescript
interface Named {
  name: string;
}

function sayHi(obj: Named) {
  console.log(`Hi, my name is ${obj.name}.`);
}

sayHi({ name: "Peter", age: 42 }); // Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'age' does not exist in type 'Named'.(2345)

const p = { name: "Peter", age: 42 };
sayHi(p);
```

```typescript
interface Named {
  name: string;
}

const q: Named = { name: "Peter", age: 42 }; // Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'age' does not exist in type 'Named'.(2345)

const p = { name: "Peter", age: 42 };
const q: Named = p;
```

- if all properties are optional, must at least implement one, i.e. not none

```typescript
interface Named {
  gender?: string;
}

const p = { name: "Peter", age: 42 };
const q: Named = p; // Type '{ name: string; age: number; }' has no properties in common with type 'Named'.(2559)
```

- allows to extend existing types ???


## Control Flow Analysis

- TS narrows down types to more specific types when it can
- in if statements, switch statements, loops, conditional ternaries, etc.
- using type guards in condition, e.g. `typeof`, `instanceof`, equality operator, truthiness
- beware: as of March 2020 can't rely fully on TS, doesn't catch all edge cases yet, needs to still understand JS, e.g. type coercion of loose equality operator [#37251](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37251)
