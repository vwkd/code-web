# HTTP cache

[TOC]


<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction

- proxy server that temporarily serves stored response from similar previous request
- forwards request it hasn't seen already, stores response for a certain amount of time
- intercepts request that it has seen already, serves stored response for that certain amount of time
- can be private or public
- advantages:
  - fast, because loads local data instead of fetching remote data
  - efficient, because reduces load on network and server
- disadvantages:
  - complex, because needs to update at right time to not end up with outdated content
  - risky, because Web server can not ask proxy server to update (except public proxies that it can control)



## Cacheable responses

any resource that gives the same response for two requests at any given time can be cached until it changes
  i.e. that doesn't depend on request body
  can cache hypertext documents, static assets, REST API
  can not cache GraphQL API, because response depends on query in request body
beware: is not equivalent to static / dynamic Web server, can dynamically build the same response, or can statically vary based on request body
just needs to figure out how long, the hard part is to figure out how long this is, without the Web server being able to notify proxy

two problems:
similarity, to which request which response
duration, how long to serve cached response

request must be similar, same URL, same method, 

caches response body for given URL
- can only cache resources that don't change
- only for `GET` HTTP method because safe (and has response body)
- only for sub-`5xx` HTTP status code because server error


## Public / shared cache

- HTTP cache on network, e.g. ISP, CDN, before Web server, etc.
- serves multiple users
- can only cache non-personalised responses
- used often in front of dynamic Web server



## Private cache

- HTTP cache on client, e.g. Browser cache, Service Worker, etc.
- serves single user
- can also cache personalised responses
- used in every client

beware: all network requests from client, e.g. URL bar, hyperlinks, resources, Fetch API, etc.

- beware: can not rely on cache, resources may be deleted early, e.g. limited disk space, user action, etc. ❗️
- beware: manual refresh by user requests resource from server even if cache hit, but conditional request if revalidation tags ❗️

### On client

can cache manually using Service worker
can bypass / update cache using Fetch API and `cache` property of options






### Web server

HTML can't be cached long

REST API responses can be cached
GraphQL API responses can't be cached

- by default enabled, disable by set via `Cache-Control` response header
  `no-store`: no cache

### Location

- set via `Cache-Control` response header
  `private` / `public`: only private / public, defaults to private if omitted

### Freshness

- duration a cached response is kept
- set via `Cache-Control` response header
  `max-age`: time in seconds
- relative to response time
- beware: don't leave out, otherwise proxy will use a default

- beware: during duration Web server can not update resource on proxy (except if on public proxy that it can control)
beware: don't just reuse a smallish `Cache-Control`, can't invalidate cache if a resource changed earlier, website can even break if doesn't refetch interdependent resource to one that isn't cached (or was deleted from cache) ⚠️

<!-- todo: update hypertext document + linked resource ==> two inder-dependent resources (e.g. hypertext document and CSS) -->

beware: careful what caches, if caches hypertext document but not linked resources, can break website because newer resources with old hypertext document
never change linked resources for a hypertext document that is allowed to be cached

but can version URLs of resources, e.g. hash in filename
must serve old resource at least as long as the caching time of the inter-dependency from the time of change

instead can version URL of resource
set expiration time to maximum value, i.e. one year `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000`
if resource changes, updates URL
beware: this doesn't work for hypertext documents since URL would change, can only do for linked resources, updates hypertext document and proxy refetches because are new, e.g. `.css`, `.js`, etc.
can automate in build process
then can cache hypertext document again

### Revalidation

after cached resource expired, proxy can try to revalidate before discarding it
- validates cache before discarding, instead of always requesting new resource
conditional request
- after cache expires, instead of fetching again, can ask if changed and if not can reuse existing cache

- set via `Cache-Control` response header `no-cache` and `must-revalidate`
  `no-cache`: revalidate before using cache, i.e. misnomer, doesn't mean "no cache"
  `must-revalidate`: revalidate after expired, i.e. misnomer, doesn't mean "must revalidate"

needs to send fingerprint of resource in `ETag` response header (or `Last-Modified`)
doesn't matter what it is, usually it's hash of content

proxy sends conditional request using `If-None-Match` (or `If-Modified-Since`) request header with fingerprint of resource
Web server sends resource if fingerprint changed
otherwise sends `304 Not Modified` with empty body and new `Cache-Control` header until which proxy reuses cache

### Variation

cached response bodies are stored by request URL
  may not be right response if request uses content negotiation, e.g. language
  response can include `Vary` response header, names of header fields that can vary, e.g. `Vary: Accept-Language`
  cached response is stored according to request URL and varied header fields, served only when matches
  beware: content negotiation header field values can differ by implementation, needs to normalise values in proxy, e.g. for `Accept-Language` could be `fr-FR` or `fr_FR`, etc.
beware: content negotiation doesn't change for single end user, can leave out `Vary`, only use if there is public proxy cache on the way
