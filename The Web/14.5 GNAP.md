# GNAP


<!-- ToDo: write once GNAP is released

differences:
- client sends data to AS as token endpoint as JSON instead of in query string, e.g. scopes can have hierarchy for multiple RSs, etc. ðŸŽ‰
- for user-to-machine, client sends data to AS beforehand on trusted back channel, transmits only opaque identifier on front channel ðŸŽ‰
- ...

questions:
- does GNAP replace bearer tokens for tokens that are bound to the TLS connection? Since Token Binding is dead (not implemented in FF, Safari, removed from Chrome), how would that look like?
