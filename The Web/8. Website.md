[TOC]

<!-- ToDo: finish -->


## Introduction

- set of web pages (and associated resources) located under single domain name
- static or dynamic
- client-side "rendered" or server-side "rendered"



## Web page

- hypertext document (and associated resources) accessible via URL on WWW
- beware: web page viewed in browser can look completely different due to JavaScript


## Web app

- modern interactive website like a native application
dynamic website that behaves like a native application
hypertext documents overloaded with lots of CSS and JavaScript to make it behave dynamic, see A second Web

## Static website

- website whose web pages are loaded from static location by Web server
- content of HTTP response for given URL can not be personalised for each request
files transmitted can be personalised
- often used to serve web page whose content is always the same
- beware: personalisation of web page is still possible using client-side JavaScript, e.g. AJAX ??? HTTP request to HTTP API

beware: don't confuse personalisation with interactivity, JavaScript can always provide both

advantages:
  - fast serving, because of no additional server-side processing
  - cachable, e.g. can use CDNs
  - doesn't need custom Web server, e.g. can use static site hosts
  - can uncouple Web server from database, access database through HTTP API on different server
  - results in better latency, better scaling, easier hosting, better security

stored on server as-is

unrendered website is same for each request, i.e. HTML file and linked files are always the same
but JS when executed can personalise it!!! Either from HTTP endpoint API, or through it Browser APIs, e.g. current time, location, etc.


The web server does not perform any rendering as the result of a real-time request
simply return HTML and other resources from from a file system

website which is always identical when requested
website in which requests can only be made for read-only server files.
every time a given file is requested, each user gets exactly the same file
BUT WEBSITE ON BROWSER MIGHT LOOK DIFFERENT DUE TO JS!!!

serve content directly from the web-server's file-system exactly as stored
serves the cached page files to the user directly from the file-system

content of HTTP response is loaded from static file "as-is" stored
can not personalize content of response, is always the same for each user 
i.e. unpersonalised resource behind URL
beware: can still personalise website on client-side, e.g. using AJAX and a HTTP API of a database ❗️
  can do almost everything using a static site and client-side JS, better for user in every case

static server needs to only support `GET` since data doesn't change

doesn't need custom Web server, can use static site hosts, e.g. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [surge](https://surge.sh/), etc.
can separate database from Web Server, more security
-> better latency, better scaling

beware: is not at all limited to HTML, unpersonalised static sites can include JS just as well to be interactive

can write using only client-side languages

## Dynamic website

- website whose web pages are dynamically generated on-the-fly by Web server
- content of HTTP response for given URL can be personalised for each request
files transmitted can not be personalised
- often used to create web page from HTML template with content from database

drawbacks:
  - slow serving, because of additional server-side processing
  - not cachable, e.g. can't use CDNs
  - needs custom Web server, e.g. can't use static site hosts
  - can't uncouple Web server from database
  - results in worse latency, worse scaling, more difficult hosting, worse security

build web page (?) and resources in real-time

content of HTTP response is generated dynamically on-the-fly
can personalize content of response, make different for each user
i.e. personalised resource behind URL

often involves HTML templates that are populated with content from a database
often used for HTML, e.g. populate template with content from database
often used with HTML templates and database to fill in templates



beware: is not at all limited to HTML, could just as well generate any resource dynamically on-the-fly like a JavaScript file

needs to write with additional server-side languages, e.g. PHP, etc.


## Static site generator

compiler of dynamically written website to static website
allows to write dynamical website but compile to statical website
write dynamically and publish statically
gives best of both worlds, as long as doesn't need personalisation ?!?!
"render" content into HTML files, although "render" should be "populate"
at build time

allow template files
"rendering" here is just "assembling", not rendering visually, just populating file
-> server-side rendering

may also allow to populate with content from database
beware: is only at build time, not dynamic webite !!!

Sapper, Hugo, Eleventy, Jekyll

ESSENTIALLY TEMPLATING ENGINE ?!

## LAMP stack

ESSENTIALLY DYNAMIC SITES

???
old architecture for building websites

web server that builds together site in real time

backend is Web server itself, information is included in site on build time of site on request
-> front-end anD back-end are tightly coupled

## JAMstack

ESSENTIALLY STATIC SITE
ESSENTIALLY STATIC SITE THAT USES AJAX TO PERSONALISE !!!


stack consists of JavaScript, APIs, and Markup (HTML)
When I think "static" I think of the JAMstack.

???
modern architecture for building websites
uses JavaScript, APIs and HTML Markup, not require a custom Web server I.E. STATIC SITE??!!
static sites, generate at deploy time, just serve on request, e.g. through CDN
backend is simply API, e.g. JSON
  separate from Web server of page
  server-side processes become microservice APIs, e.g. Google Cloud Functions
-> front-end anf back-end are loosely coupled


+ speed:
  serving page is separate from API / database
  can use CDN
+ security:
  since API and Web server are separate, not vulnerable to SQL injection or server-side code injection attacks ???
  Managed Web Server (e.g. CDN) is more up-to-date, stop DDOS attacks, etc.
+ development:
  front end is separate from back end, needs to access API only, not know server scripting language

## "Rendering"

to generate the site in advance

can be client-side or server-side

BASICALLY WHO BUILDS THE DOM, HTML (BUILT ON SERVER) OR JS (EXECUTED ON CLIENT)

content is converted to HTML in the server / client

where the HTML is being built, on server or client
can be on static or dynamic site, although almost never uses CSR on a dynamic site SINCE WOULD BE JS THAT NEEDS TO BE PERSONALISED


## Routing

can be client-side or server-side

SSR loads new page from server as always
sends duplicate information in markup file, site "flashes" since browser doesn't know what stays the same
link to other page is resolved by browser itself, like loading a new page

CSR updates DOM using AJAX and HTTP API ??
link to other page is resolved by AJAX and partial DOM update, URL is updated by JS
worse accessibility because browser doesn't "know" that on a new page, e.g. doesn't focus top of page, doesn't read title, etc.

SSR + CS-Routing: request URL is SSR, subsequent routes are CSR (?)


## Client-side "rendering"

ONLY RELEVANT FOR STATIC WEBSITE SINCE DYNAMIC WEBSITE CAN'T BE BUILD WITH FRONT-END FRAMEWORK ANYWAYS???

"rendering" here is meant as building the DOM

ESSENTIALLY EMPTY SITE AS HTML & CSS, VIEW & INTERACTIVITY WITH JS

populating of HTML template only on client from script file
script file for whole application
typical component framework, e.g. React, Vue, Svelte, etc.

slower page load, since can't view before is interactive due to JS
worse SEO, since search engine crawler doesn't see data
less accessible, e.g. JS disabled

client-side framework builds the web page

couples viewing and interacting, can view only when interactive

can use for client-side routing, gets other routes through AJAX to HTTP API
can create each route dynamically directly in the browser

Instead of parsing HTML to create the DOM, client-side rendering uses JavaScript to create it. A minimal HTML document serves as the application container, and only contains links to the JavaScript and CSS necessary to render the application.

## Server-side "rendering"


ONLY RELEVANT FOR STATIC WEBSITE SINCE DYNAMIC WEBSITE CAN'T BE BUILD WITH FRONT-END FRAMEWORK ANYWAYS???

"rendering" here is meant as filling out HTML file, "hydrating it", template rendering instead of graphical rendering

render the same components into HTML strings on the server, send them directly to the browser, and finally "hydrate" the static markup into a fully interactive app on the client.

KIND OF LIKE PRE-RENDERING IN IMAGINARY BROWSER
ESSENTIALLY BASIC SITE AS HTML & CSS, ONLY INTERACTIVITY WITH JS

"rendering" is wrong word for "building HTML and CSS"

populating of HTML template already on build as much as possible
script file only for interactivity
needs ??? framework, e.g. Gatsby, next.js, Sapper, etc.

faster page load, since can view already before is interactive due to JS
better SEO, since search engine crawler sees data
more accessible, e.g. JS disabled

server-side framework (?) builds the web page

separates viewing from interacting, can view already before is interactive

??? called Pre-Rendering if done at build time, not personalisable
  
??? called SSR if done at request time, personalisable, essentially dynamic website

hydration: process of using client-side JavaScript to add application state and interactivity to server-rendered HTML
