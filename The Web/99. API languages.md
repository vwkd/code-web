## Representational State Transfer (REST)

- use the proper HTTP methods instead of different URLs for same resource ???
- often called RESTful API

consists of multiple endpoints with fixed data

## GraphQL

also server-side runtime for executing queries, runtime for fulfilling those queries

a single endpoint
sends single request in GraphQL
gets single JSON response

advantages
