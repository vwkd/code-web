## Introduction

- authentication and authorization
- authentication: verification of identity
- authorization: verification of permissions
- can't have one without the other, doesn't make sense
- must be done with each request since HTTP is stateless
- beware: don't roll own method, use OAuth ⚠️



## API Auth

API keys = direct access
OAuth credentials flow = delegated access
