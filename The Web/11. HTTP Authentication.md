# HTTP authentication

<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction

- ???
don't do manually, best practices continually evolve

can use symmetric key as query parameter, or header, or body somehow

can obtain symmetric key by sending username and password over HTTPS, e.g. form
can store symmetric key in a cookie



## API

- traditionally used a secret key
- modern way is using OAuth 2.0

## API keys

- never hardcode into source code, instead use environment variables
- can set environment variables
  - remotely: save in UI, e.g. GitHub, Netlify, etc.
  - locally (single use): provide as command-line arguments
  - locally (multiple use): create `.env` file that's excluded from VCS with keys, write script that loads content and sets environment variables, e.g. `dotenv` module
- beware: always document required environment variables, e.g. create `sample.env` that's not excluded from VCS with sample keys ❗️
- beware: on client has no environment variables, needs to use proxy server that does request on its behalf, e.g. FaaS ❗️
<!-- How to limit access to proxy server to only come from instances of the web page ?? CAN'T ?!?! just within browser can limit using CORS but no guarantees from manual clients like curl ?? Could require a cookie set by the page, but that could be generated by an attacker as well and sent via curl, !! CAN WITH AUTHENTICATION -->
