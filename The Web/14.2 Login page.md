# Login page
(HTML form-based authentication)

[TOC]


<!-- todo: link to Session for building Auth 
! YOU CAN HAVE AUTH WITHOUT SESSION, see 14.1
-->

## Introduction

custom login page
used in U2M, delegated access
keeps a session, such that next time doesn't need to log in again
beware: don't confuse token here with authorization code or access token in OAuth, token here keeps session with UA ⚠️
beware: for login page only, don't use standalone, instead use OAuth

- login, password, MFA
- keep session with UA, e.g. session cookie
- session management, e.g. revoke single session, revoke all
- user group


## Motivation

use session for auth, instead of doing full auth as part of every request
needs custom login page and session

prevent sending credentials with every request, only with first
- temporary credentials, not valid indefinitely, finite attack window
- not all requests contain password, finite attack surface
- not all endpoints see credentials
(- also doesn't store credentials on client, which should not have done in the first place)

pros:
- functionality, because can customise login page, transmit credentials however wants, e.g. appearance, validation, description, client JS, etc.
- security, because can customise login page, e.g. multiple factors, etc.
- cheap, because server needs to validate only key, doesn't do full authentication against database with computing cryptographic hash

cons
- complex, because needs custom login page, e.g. remember redirect target, e.g. in server session, hidden field in login form, etc.
- security, because needs custom login page, e.g. XSS attack, phishing attack, etc.
- latency, because needs additional roundtrip for login page
- attackable, because login details visible to login page, instead of only to UA and server, e.g. JS can read



## Token

- deputy credentials
- used as symmetric key, shared secret
- beware: weakest link in chain, are keys to kingdom for duration of validity, don't require other factors ⚠️





## Browser-based

## Flow

(redirects to login page with form)
submits plaintext credentials through form to same login page, usually as POST to not expose in URL
(may include redirect URL in hidden form field or in POST URL)
verifies against user database, if true creates session state, token = session ID
(if successful, redirects back to where came from with `301 Found`, with token in cookie)
if failed, stays on same page with `401 Unauthenticated`
beware: don't use `200 OK` if login failed ❗️

returns token in body, or header
beware: not in URL, because might end up in logs, bookmarks, etc.
in subsequent requests checks token from cookie

- may implement reasonable checks, e.g. user agent, IP address, etc.
although always arbitrary, e.g. VPN, flight, etc.
- lifetime after last request can be sliding to extend with every request, but should always have a maximum lifetime
e.g. Google 1 year
long lifetime, e.g. Google 1 year
<!-- 
Idle / Inactivity Timeout: amount of time a session remains active since last activity
Absolute Timeout: amount of time a session remains active since creation 
-->

- can rotate token on every request
AS issues new token with every request, AS stores old tokens, if old token is used knows that was breached (either attacker or client has current one), revoke all tokens
e.g. fixation attack
-> doesn't help against theft after last use of token until it expires

?? advantage of using refresh token
    - can differentiate auto-login from real login, allow only access to non-sensitive parts, require password for sensitive parts

## Storage: Cookies

token stored on device

<!-- todo: below works only if AS and RS are on same domain! -->
cookie: set as secure, HttpOnly, set domain and path, set samesite
should implement other checks, e.g. user agent, IP address
beware: don't use other storage
    e.g. JWT and send manually in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, instead use OAuth directly

![request flow for HTML form-based authentication with token stored in cookie](static/authhtmlcookie.svg)

pros:
- easy, because automatically transmitted, e.g. no JS
- no JS, all requests, doesn't need JS since transmitted automatically
- XSS secure (if set `HttpOnly`), because not JS readable
cons:
- always, because automatically transmitted always, e.g. exact routes, only by JS requests, etc.
- CSRF vulnerable, because automatically transmitted
    -> can use CSRF token
- browser only, because relies on cookies


## Security

- can use additional security measures, e.g. # of login attemps, IP address location, etc.

### CSRF token

<!-- todo:?! -->
random token set in cookie `X-CSRF-TOKEN`, non-HttpOnly
JS reads cookie and sends token back in custom request header (or in hidden form field)
since only JS on own page can read cookie
-> in SPA (written in JS) can use CSRF-cookie (anti-forgery token, CSRF token) as protection, random token set in cookie `X-CSRF-TOKEN` non-HttpOnly, JS reads cookie and sends token back in custom request header (or in hidden form field), since only JS on own page can read cookie
  but needs JS to make requests
  when requesting /login (or /register), server sets csrf token as cookie and in hidden input field, in request (POST /login (or /request) route) compares csrf token in cookie and form field
  match only if on own page, because only own page can set cookie ?!
  beware: use CSRF token for any mutating action



## Features

- login
    always hash even if user doesn't exist, otherwise timing attack
    make string comparison constant in time, e.g. in database query for auth token ID, otherwise timing attack
        -> advanced attack, can mitigate with rate limit...
    require credentials again for sensitive operations, otherwise CSRF attack
    on error, don't leak if user exists or not, just "invalid login"
    make accessible, e.g. keyboard, paste-able, password managers work, etc.

- register
    password strength, stronger for admin users, educate about password managers
        high min and very high max, e.g. 12 to 64 or 128
        Unicode range
        check entropy instead of arbitrary rules
    check common and breached passwords, e.g. HIBP API
- email confirmation
- password reset
    don't leak if user exists or not, just "if account exists, we sent email"
    don't reset if email is not confirmed!!!
    no security questions, since basically weaker password
    store hash of reset token, not token itself, otherwise database theft gets free password resets
- account deletion

- allow admin to force password change, don't log in until password is changed
- allow MFA, don't log in until MFA is put in
- verify email, don't log in until verified
-> can use a session with no roles, such that can access account, but can't do anything else until confirmed email

- rate limit on all routes, esp. /login, return 429 with helpful error message
attacks: can either throttle login to specific account or by specific IP address, or to all accounts / by any IP address
    single-machine bfa on many accounts with single password => easy, IP throttling
    single-machine bfa on single accounts with many passwords => easy, IP throttling
    distributed bfa on many accounts with single password => hard, global throttling, when global login failure rate increases too fast
    distributed bfa on single accounts with many passwords => easy, username throttling
    => always impedes legitimate users, since by assumption can't discern legitimate users from bot without captcha
same IP different usernames => throttle IP
same IP same username multiple times => throttle IP, throttle username
multiple IPs same username => throttle username, throttle IPs
send users notifications they logged in per email, with link to say "wasn't me"
    then can block IPs targeted
beware: don't block IPs permanently, otherwise infected user machine is also blocked, instead block increasingly, e.g. 2^x days with max. 32 days
beware: don't lock accounts, otherwise attacker locks all accounts using DDOS
beware: don't use CAPTCHAS, since evil against humans, inaccessible, etc. rather accept tiny fraction of bot attempts 

motivate MFA

log all attempts, logins, failures, etc.

- rotate token when user data changes, e.g. password change, role change, etc.

## BEARER Token
<!-- todo: consider moving to Auth since is more general 

there are multiple token use cases
UA -> AS
    two parties, usually reference token since no third party
client -> RS
    three parties with AS
    usually self-contained token if RS != AS
    usually reference token if RS = AS since can just load session
        -> traditional monolith

MAYBE DON'T EXPLAIN TOKENS HERE, LEAVE FOR OAUTH,
HERE USES ONLY REFERENCE TOKEN ANYWAYS...
-->

- the longer the lifetime the more time attacker has to steal and use it

token is deputy credentials, essentially temporary password
    needs same security as password, hard to bruteforce
    unique and random and long !!!
    if stored, store securely

## Token types
<!-- todo: see reference token in 13.3 -->

- token can be stateful or stateless (of AS!, and therefore RS tightly or loosely coupled)

### reference token

token = session ID
use when AS = RS, RS can just lookup session, take infos from session directly
key itself that is mapped to user in session list

AS creates session data from user, random session ID, 
     {sessionId, userId, role, loginAttempts, expires}
usually uses in-memory storage
    if crashes kills sessions
    periodically needs to purge expired sessions, otherwise memory leak

adv:
    - low bandwith, since only identifier
    - private, since doesn't contain user identifying information that client could read
    - revocable, since RS needs to contact AS, e.g. logout, role change, password reset, etc.
disadv:
    - storage (stateful), since AS needs to keep session state, although usually always keeps session state
    (- RS can't verify token itself) ONLY IMPORTANT IF AS != RS
        -> doesn't scale

### self-contained token

token = self-contained token, signed JWT
use when AS != RS, RS can't just lookup session, with session ID would need to send to AS with every request, would be tight coupling, instead contain info directly in token
-> can't revoke token without making stateful again, use primarily for long-lived information, e.g. userID

adv:
    - storage (stateless), since AS doesn't need to keep session state, although usually always keeps session state
    (- RS can verify token itself) ONLY IMPORTANT IF AS != RS
        -> scales
disadv:
    - high bandwith, since contains user data
    - not private, since contains user identifying information that client could read
    - not revocable, since RS doesn't need to contact AS, e.g. logout, role change, password reset, etc.
    


## Token transmission

receives in header or body
sends in header always
don't send in URL, may be shared, bookmarked, etc.
    e.g. API keys are bad if in URL

### Custom header

in `Authorization` header, manually
can choose any storage: memory, Web Storage, even cookies

- server sends symmetric key as token, in body
- client sends it in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` request header, on own requests
- usually token, but not necessarily
- stored in custom storage, e.g. Web storage
DON'T USE WEB STORAGE TO STORE KEY!!! XSS!!!
 instead use memory + refresh token in cookie

- often used for SPAs (since written in JS)
and APIs who has clients that may not be browsers, i.e. no cookies

pros:
- manual, because needs custom request to include header, mitigates CSRF, e.g. multiple domains
- universal, because doesn't rely on cookie functionality, e.g. native apps

cons:
- Web storage, needs to store manually, e.g. setting, deleting, etc.
- JS only, because needs custom request to include header
- XSS attackable, since uses JS and Web storage
- doesn't work for sub-domains, since Web storage is only on exact domain

- can also use cookie for storage instead of Web storage because accessible on all subdomains, as before but just loads from cookie instead of Web storage, server ignores cookie in requests, wastes bandwith by including twice as cookie



## Token formats

JWT: standardised token format in JSON
beware: don't confuse JWT with type of token, can be used as reference or self-contained token


/////////////////////////////////////

## App

sends credentials directly to endpoint
does verification
returns token in body of 200 OK


## storage

store however

beware: on any device can extract token if has access to device, e.g. browser extension, outside browser, etc.
- beware: client storage isn't secure, can always extract key while it's there


////////////////////////////////////

## Storing user data

only store user data you actually need, the less you have the less can be stolen, e.g. nobody needs "favorite color", etc.

store hash + salt passwords
    Argon2id, bcrypt, or PBKDF2
    as slow as possible to slow down attacker, but not too slow to be unusable on login verification, usually less than 1s
    needs to increase work factor over time
submit plaintext password, verify hash on server against database
    don't hash on client, since then hash itself becomes the password which is stored in cleartext in database, i.e. stealing database means you can log in directly
may add pepper, private secret on server-side in every hash function, but difficult to store, difficult to rotate, etc.
    -> better just encrypt hash, encryption key is pepper, this way can de/encrypt easily and transition

username is case-insensitive, store as lowercase
    unique

/////////////////////////////////

## Passwords

- long
- random, no dictionary words, no personal data, e.g. name, birthday, etc.
- unique, never reuse twice
- store securely, otherwise pointless, e.g. password manager, not browser, etc.
- use securely, otherwise pointless, e.g. phishing website, browser extension that reads form fields, key logger, shoulder-surfing, etc.
- use MFA, another layer in case PW is stolen, e.g. TOTP, not SMS, etc.
