# HTML form-based authentication

[TOC]


<!-- todo: replace in 13.2 -->

## Session

- time between login and logout
    time that is logged in, consecutive time that is recognised as a particular user
- wants to maximise due to annoyance of log in, but minimise security risk
- problem: HTTP is stateless, needs to keep state manually over multiple request-response cycles
  -> very complex, all of that would not have been necessary if HTTP were stateful

beware: often also used in session token based authentication for data stored by server


## Introduction

- uses temporary symmetric key / shared secret, "token"
    NOT NECESSARILY, SIGNED TOKEN
prevents sending username and password
    infinite attack window since password doesn't change
    infinite attack surface, since all requests contain password, all endpoints on server see password
    permanent access since password doesn't change

- needs login to generate symmetric key
needs custom login page to authenticate user
can use separate server for login, separate storage of user credentials from API, password never visits API
    can outsource identity provider, see token-based auth
-> API doesn't even need to manage users if stateless

- server-side can be stateful or stateless
- symmetric key must be stored on client, see below for different methods

- beware: symmetric key allows full access to account for duration of validity
- beware: client storage isn't secure, can always extract key while it's there

pros:
- functionality, because can customise login page, transmit credentials however wants, e.g. appearance, validation, description, client JS, etc.
- security, because can customise login page, e.g. multiple factors, etc.
- cheap, because server needs to validate only key, doesn't do full authentication again

cons
- complex, because needs custom login page, e.g. remember redirect target, e.g. in server session, hidden field in login form, etc.
- security, because needs custom login page, e.g. XSS attack, phishing attack, etc.
- latency, because needs additional roundtrip for login page
- attackable, because login details visible to login page, instead of only to UA and server, e.g. JS can read

beware: only use over HTTPS, to verify identify

///
Identity provider can he separarte from Services Provider (e.g. API)
Want IP to be independent Microservice,
-single Login, Registration, Password Forget, etc.
-credentials only stored in IP
-SP and IP aren't coupled, can scale independently

Access SP, if not authenticated redirect to IP, login to IP, gets temporary token, redirects back to SP, present token, SP validates token and grants access
(Called "OpenID Connect"???)

IP keeps session, such that with more SPs using this same IP they get SSO for free
At most screen flickering due to redirect to IP and back

SSOut (Logout) goes over Backchannel, SP calls logout on IP, IP calls logout on rest of SPs to revoke access tokens

Alternatively logout over front channel, deletes all access tokens in browser
-problem 1: needs browser (?)
-problem 2: attacker can still use access token

Refresh tokens are long lived access tokens to IP, not passed to SP
///

## Login

- server redirects to login page, submits credentials through form, usually as POST request to not expose in URL
- if failed, stays on same page with `401 Unauthenticated`
- if successful, redirects back to where came from with `301 Found`, with symmetric key
- beware: don't use `200 OK` if login failed ❗️

![request flow for HTML form-based authentication with token-based key stored in Web Storage](static/authhtmltoken.svg)

how auth endpoint generates symmetric key is invisible to user, could rely on third party, etc., e.g. OAuth

can use additional security measures, e.g. # of login attemps, IP address location, etc.

nowadays don't build login system, trust big third party, e.g. Apple, GitHub, Google, no need to manage passwords 
just use tokens

## Key

short time to live

often uses both, session for web clients, token for native apps / APIs, since ??? XSS not applicable to native apps

### session token / reference token

beware: a specific term to differentiate from authentication token, don't consuse, both are used for authentication !!!
stateful

- symmetric key is random session ID
- server keeps session list of session ID with associated user, e.g. in memory
 ??? HOW TO PREVENT MEMORY LEAK, old sessions need to be purged periodically
 guess: in-memory storage, cleans up periodically all whose expiry date is in past, if server shuts down loses all session data (including tokens)
 {sessionId, userId, role, loginAttempts, expires}
-  usually used with Cookie-based auth
- pros:
    - revokable, because server can delete session at any time, e.g. logout, role change, password reset, etc.
    - low bandwith, since contains identifier for state on server
- cons:
    - scaling, performance, because server must be stateful, needs to keep state

can also let server sign cookie
?? WHY? what difference does it make to send the session ID directly unsigned? Attacker can't guess it either, since random

In most situations best choice, because doesn't leak user info to client side
    only when don't want to be able to revoke session, use token, e.g. password reset link (??? NEEDS TO REVOKE AFTER FIRST OPEN), download link
use token for AUTHORIZATION in large distributed systems where otherwise would need to keep super chatty internal server for permission querying

### self-contained token
beware: a specific term to differentiate from session token, don't consuse, both are used to mantain session !!!
stateless
beware: could have only some state, and rest in database, but for simplicity assume that is either all data in token or none (i.e. session ID)

- symmetric key is user identifying information and expiration date signed by server, e.g. JWT
- usually used with Custom storage-based auth
- pros:
    - scaling, performance, because server can be stateless, doesn't need to keep state
    only needs to store key used for signatures!!!
    <!-- - permissions, because can include arbitrary information in signed thing -->
- cons:
    - not revokable, because valid until expires
    no logout route, can just delete on client, but if token was stolen because remains valid to server until expires
    - high bandwith, since contains state itself

- could have deny list (better than allow list since much less) for revoked (or valid) tokens on server, makes logout work again, but undermines statelessness, then is back again to session based key.

- can also use for authorization ??? ANYTHING THAT IDENTIFIES USER CAN USE AS AUTHORIZATION, I.E. ALSO COOKIE
code permissions into it, saves database calls
- beware: only store data needed for identification, not more user data since can all be stolen, e.g. Name,
beware: token is usually not encrypted just signed

beware: use strong secret for signature hashing
if single service can use symmetric secret for signature
if multiple services, use private key from private-public keypair for signature and share only public key with other service

rotate secret periodically
start using new secret for new tokens, check new and old secrets for max lifetime of a token since change, because may get token still signed with old key
    use key identifier to not need to check all old secrets, store secret on server with key identifier, send key identifier in token, can use right secret for each token 

can use when auth server is not own server
own server verifies signature using public key of auth server

session ID on other hand doesn't contain user identifying information, is just key itself that is mapped to user in session list, otherwise server wouldn't know if key is valid
    token on other hand contains the user information and is itself the key for that since it's signed
both reference user info somehow, but are opposite
-> session ID is stored on server, while token stores some user info from server
token is bigger than sesion ID, consider bandwith and storage
decide between value of statelessness on server, and cost of transmission of state for every request
    but also not revokableness

beware: don't confuse token with JWT, JWT is just format, can be used for both session ID and token !!!!
JWT: standardised token format in JSON

can use good as one time password, e.g. 30min valid password reset, 30 min valid download, etc.
single-use authorization token
only when don't want to be able to revoke session, e.g. password reset link (??? NEEDS TO REVOKE AFTER FIRST OPEN), download link

use key management service, handles safe storage of keys and rotation, e.g. Hashicorp Vault, Google Cloud Key Management, etc.

## Transmission

send in header
don't send in URL, may be shared, bookmarked, etc.

receives in header or body

### Cookie

in `Cookie` header, automatically by browser
needs to store in cookies, can't choose another storage

- server sends symmetric key as cookie, in header
- client sends it as cookie on every subsequent request
- usually uses session ID, but not necessarily

pros:
- easy, because automatically transmitted, e.g. no JS
- no JS, all requests, doesn't need JS since transmitted automatically
- XSS secure (if set `HttpOnly`)

const:
- easy, because automatically transmitted, can't decide on which domains and paths, can't decide when (e.g. on JS but not on top-level navigation for CSRF reasons), only works on UAs with cookie, e.g. API accessed by native apps, etc.
- CSRF vulnerable, because automatically transmitted
-> in SPA (written in JS) can use CSRF-cookie (anti-forgery token, CSRF token) as protection, random token set in cookie `X-CSRF-TOKEN` non-HttpOnly, JS reads cookie and sends token back in custom request header (or in hidden form field), since only JS on own page can read cookie
  but needs JS to make requests
  when requesting /login (or /register), server sets csrf token as cookie and in hidden input field, in request (POST /login (or /request) route) compares csrf token in cookie and form field
  match only if on own page, because only own page can set cookie ?!
  beware: use CSRF token for any mutating action

### Custom header

in `Authorization` header, manually
can choose any storage: memory, Web Storage, even cookies

- server sends symmetric key as token, in body
- client sends it in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` request header, on own requests
- usually token, but not necessarily
- stored in custom storage, e.g. Web storage
DON'T USE WEB STORAGE TO STORE KEY!!! XSS!!!
 instead use memory + refresh token in cookie

- often used for SPAs (since written in JS)
and APIs who has clients that may not be browsers, i.e. no cookies

pros:
- manual, because needs custom request to include header, mitigates CSRF, e.g. multiple domains
- universal, because doesn't rely on cookie functionality, e.g. native apps

cons:
- Web storage, needs to store manually, e.g. setting, deleting, etc.
- JS only, because needs custom request to include header
- XSS attackable, since uses JS and Web storage
- doesn't work for sub-domains, since Web storage is only on exact domain

- can also use cookie for storage instead of Web storage because accessible on all subdomains, as before but just loads from cookie instead of Web storage, server ignores cookie in requests, wastes bandwith by including twice as cookie



## Best practices

often uses multiple keys
one access key, less securely stored, but short lived
one refresh key, more securely stored, long lived

### Two cookies
<!-- cookie based, for traditional websites, etc. -->

<!-- todo: two cookies, short lived insecure access cookie, long lived but more secure -->

on login to auth.example.com generates two cookies
access cookie, HttpOnly, secure, scope /, 15 min duration
refresh cookie, HttpOnly, secure, scope auth.example.com/refresh, session ID duration

JS timeout, just before access cookie expires,
call /refresh endpoint, get new access cookie and refresh cookie
??? WHAT IF JS DEACTIVATED
<!-- ??? alternatively refresh access cokie with every request where valid, would need to have auth logic on every route... NOT GOOD -->
.....

-> No XSS since secure cookies
-> CSRF risk, although minimal due to short duration of access cookie, would need double attack within 15 min first to /refresh, then to endpoint

### Two tokens, Memory and Cookie-based
<!-- token based, for API, custom requests, etc. -->

instead of storing access token in Web storage can also keep in memory, no XSS
give access token short time to live, refresh access token just before expires
keep time of access token very short, e.g. 15 mins, refresh access token just before expires
on login on auth server generates token as well as longer lived refresh_token
    refresh_token stored on server like session ID, !!! actually is just a session id, because has state, must be able to be revoked !
    refresh_token is HttpOnly cookie, restricted to specific domain and path of auth server, e.g. auth.example.com/refresh
    expiry time of refresh token like session id ??? HOW MUCH, 1 DAY?
call /refresh every 14 mins in background, otherwise API forwards to login every 15 mins because access token expires
get new access token
    also refresh token rotation: invalidates old refresh_token, gets new refresh_token, otherwise refresh token would be eternally valid, just as good as password
on application start look for refresh_token, if there use to /refresh  (e.g. otherwise needs to login when closing and reopening window because deletes memory), otherwise go to login
on logout, role change, etc. also revoke refresh_token on server
-> beware: refresh_token is even better key to steal than access token because lives longer, but since HttpOnly cookie is safe from XSS (not CSRF but doesn't matter because only valid for single auth domain that doesn't do any mutations)
-> server is stateful again, for refresh token
-> CSRF and XSS safe, like having a long-lived access token in non-JS accessible storage

advantage over pure session ID + cookie based approach is that has stateless access token, only refresh token needs state, much less frequent state access on server, instead of with every request, only with every X (duration of access cookie lifetime)
-> compromise between both worlds

PROBLEM: during 15 mins can not revoke access, e.g. role change, password reset, ...
PROBLEM: still needs cookies, what on native apps, cli apps, etc. ?!
    can simply replicate cookie functionality, read cookie value, store content, send with subsequent request...

WHAT TO DO WHEN NEEDS TO REVOKE ACCESS TOKEN?, PASSWORD CHANGE, ROLE CHANGE, ETC...
could use the changing information in hashing function for signature, e.g. password and role, if one changes, then hash won't match anymore NO, BECAUSE REINTRODUCES STATE

Also implement internal logout all function that invalidates all refresh_tokens, in case of breach can log out all users immediately

### Simple token

auth server sends token to client
client sends token to API, API checks signature of token using public key of auth server
API sets cookie on client, is used in subsequent requests

auth server can also set a cookie, use in subsequent authentications of client for other APIs 
    auth server can choose to not require a login anymore, issue token silently, called "Single Sign-On" (into auth provider)

native app can use web view, doesn't use cookies though
?? how does auth persist then
-> uses refresh token besides access token
access token duration: 1h (Azure)

### Simple cookie

1. single cookie, long lived
-> XSS prone, rather short, but then would need multiple logins
2. two cookies
