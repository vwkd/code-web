# Website architecture

[TOC]

<!-- ToDo: finish -->


## Web page

- hypertext document (and associated resources) on the WWW, i.e. accessible via an URL
- beware: web page view in browser can look completely different due to JavaScript
- beware: often used as synonym for website ❗️

### Build

- assembly of the web page
- can be static or dynamic, differs in time when web page is built
- beware: don't confuse time when built with interactivity, can always make interactive using client-side JavaScript ❗️
- beware: don't confuse web page with web page view in browser window, can always personalise using client-side JavaScript, e.g. AJAX to HTTP API, current time, location, etc. ❗️
<!-- todo: above should be "content" instead of "web page view" since web page view is defined by rendering?? -->
- beware: other resources of web page besides hypertext document are usually assumed to be static, but for dynamic web page could also generate resources on-the-fly, e.g. personalised images, style sheets, script files, etc. ❗️
- popular static site hosts include [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [surge](https://surge.sh/), etc.

#### Static web page

- built in advance
- stored on Web server assembled, e.g. file on file system
- Web server only needs to serve web page
- non-personalisable to request, e.g. user-specific data
- can use for web page that always stays the same
- can use for web page that are personalised on the client-side
- advantages:
  - low latency, because no additional server-side processing
  - cachable, because always the same, e.g. can use CDN
  - scalable, because doesn't need custom Web server, e.g. can use static site host
  - secure, because Web server doesn't build web page, i.e. uncoupled from database
- source code can be only in client-side languages, e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.
- beware: source code doesn't need to be only in client-side languages, can use compiler, e.g. Svelte, etc.

#### Dynamic web page

- built on request on-the-fly
- stored on Web server disassembled, e.g. template file, database entry
- Web server needs to build and serve web page
- personalisable to request, e.g. user-specific data
- can use for web page with accumulating content that doesn't change later, e.g. comments
- can use for separate web pages where only content differs, e.g. Wikipedia, Google
- disadvantages:
  - high latency, because additional server-side processing, e.g. limited by database speed
  - not cachable, because not always the same, e.g. can't use CDN
  - not scalable, because needs custom Web server, e.g. can't use static site host
  - insecure, because Web server also builds web page, e.g. coupled to database
- source code must be additionally in server-side languages, e.g. PHP, etc.

### Rendering

- assembly of the view of the web page
- can be server-side or client-side, differs in location where view is built
- beware: misnomer, not the build of the graphical view, but the source code that generates it ⚠️
- can think of as "filling the hypertext document", although analogy breaks down on client-side since directly manipulates DOM instead of HTML
- beware: don't confuse view with content, can always personalise content using client-side JavaScript, e.g. AJAX to HTTP API, current time, location, etc. ❗️
- beware: don't confuse rendering with interactivity, can always make interactive using client-side JavaScript ❗️
- hydration: process of adding interactivity to web page through client-side JavaScript, e.g. attach event handlers, etc.

#### Server-side rendering

- built on server, by assembling HTML
- HTML contains view, semantic
- JavaScript contains only any interactivity
- can use for web page which is not performance critical
- advantages:
  - fast load, because can view already before any JavaScript loads
  - low bandwith, because doesn't need to transmit additional JavaScript runtime
  - energy efficient, because doesn't need additional client-side script execution
  - accessible, because view doesn't depend on JavaScript, e.g. good SEO
  - independent, because doesn't necessarily need JavaScript besides HTML and CSS
- web page can be static or dynamic
- beware: sometimes called explicitly "Static rendering" for static web page ❗️
- usually web pages built with additional framework on top of client-side component framework, e.g. Sapper, Gatsby, next.js, etc.

#### Client-side rendering

- built on client, by manipulating DOM through JavaScript
- HTML contains empty skeleton, non-semantic
- JavaScript contains view and any interactivity
- can use for web page which is not performance critical, e.g. login page
- disadvantages:
  - slow load, because can view only after JavaScript loads
  - high bandwith, because needs to transmit additional JavaScript runtime
  - energy inefficient, because needs additional client-side script execution
  - inaccessible, because view depends on JavaScript, e.g. bad SEO
  - dependent, because necessarily needs JavaScript besides HTML and CSS
- web page can be static or dynamic
- beware: not used for dynamic websites usually since already generates HTML on-the-fly on server, but could also instead generate JavaScript on-the-fly ❗️
- usually web pages built with client-side component frameworks, e.g. Svelte, React, etc.



## Website

- set of web pages located under single domain name
- beware: often used as synonym for web page ❗️
- static / dynamic, when all web pages are static / dynamic
- client-side rendered / server-side rendered, when all web pages are client-side rendered / server-side rendered

### Routing

- navigation of the pages of a website
- beware: don't confuse with definition in other contexts, e.g. on Web server
- can be server-side or client-side, differs in location where navigation is built

#### Server-side routing

pages are actual web pages, exist on server, DOCUMENT
loaded through links as usual, for browser is new web page
  e.g. focuses top of page, reads title, etc.
needs to load full hypertext document (other resources are probably cached, e.g. style sheets, etc.)
full reload, flashing white
URL, history is updated by browser automatically
can keep state in memory since webpage doesn't change

disadvantages:
  - full reload, i.e. flashing white
  - high bandwith, because transmits duplicate data, e.g. HTML skeleton
advantages:
  - accessible, because browser knows it's a new page
  - independent, because doesn't necessarily need JavaScript besides HTML and CSS

???- website can be server-side or client-side rendered
although usually server-side rendered, otherwise would use client-side routing

#### Client-side routing

pages are emulated "views", don't exist on server, APPLICATION
  also called Single Page Application (SPA)
loaded by AJAX to HTTP API, partial DOM update, for browser is same web page
  e.g. doesn't focus top of page, doesn't read title, etc.
can only load data that changed
no reload, no flashing white
URL, history needs to be updated by JS such that records history, back button etc. work
  history depends on JavaScript
needs to manually update URL by JavaScript, to correctly record browser history, make back button work
  needs to make sure URL maps uniquely to program state, otherwise won't make sense
needs to manually tell analytics script that page changed
can not keep state in memory since a new webpage is loaded

can use if routes are changing dynamically, e.g. list of posts, list of products, search results, etc. ????

I.E. uses CS-rendering

advantages:
  - fast, can only replace what changed from current page, can even intelligently preload to make feel "instantaneous", e.g. on hover, on keydown (instead of keyup), etc.
  - low bandwith, because transmits only changed data (apart from additional JavaScript runtime on initial page load), e.g. JSON
disadvantages:
  - inaccessible, because browser doesn't know it's a new page
  - dependent, because necessarily needs JavaScript besides HTML and CSS

can use with server-side rendering for initial page load, mirror each route on server, then any subsequent route is client-side rendered
can use server-side rendering for initial route, then client-side rendering for subsequent routes
if combined with SS-rendering, then web pages are also exist on server, such that on initial page load gets SS rendered page, on subsequent routes CS rendered page
often used with SS rendering for initial page load, ship JS runtime, route future pages on client-side
server-side render the first page load and subsequent page updates on the client

- usually websites built with client-side component frameworks, e.g. Svelte, React, etc.
- 
declaration of routes can be file-system based, configuration based, component based, etc.

???- website can only be client-side rendered



## Static site generator

COMPILER !!!

compiler of dynamically written website to static website
allows to write dynamical website but compile to statical website
write dynamically and publish statically
gives best of both worlds, as long as doesn't need personalisation ?!?!
"render" content into HTML files, although "render" should be "populate"
at build time

allow template files
"rendering" here is just "assembling", not rendering visually, just populating file
-> server-side rendering

may also allow to populate with content from database
beware: is only at build time, not dynamic webite !!!

Sapper, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), Jekyll
https://www.staticgen.com/

ESSENTIALLY TEMPLATING ENGINE ?!

application that creates HTML pages from templates or components and a given content source


## 0th stack

initial websites were static, ss rendered, with ss routing
then became dynamic -> can do with AJAX or continuous builds
then became static, cs rendered, with cs routing
now go back again to initial

## LAMP stack

ESSENTIALLY DYNAMIC SITES

???
old architecture for building websites

web server that builds together site in real time

backend is Web server itself, information is included in site on build time of site on request
-> front-end anD back-end are tightly coupled

## JAMstack

ESSENTIALLY STATIC SITE
ESSENTIALLY STATIC SITE THAT USES AJAX TO PERSONALISE !!!


stack consists of JavaScript, APIs, and Markup (HTML)
When I think "static" I think of the JAMstack.

modern website architecture that uses JavaScript, content APIs, and markup

???
modern architecture for building websites
uses JavaScript, APIs and HTML Markup, not require a custom Web server I.E. STATIC SITE??!!
static sites, generate at deploy time, just serve on request, e.g. through CDN
backend is simply API, e.g. JSON
  separate from Web server of page
  server-side processes become microservice APIs, e.g. Google Cloud Functions
-> front-end anf back-end are loosely coupled

uncouple Web server from database, access database through HTTP API on different server

+ speed:
  serving page is separate from API / database
  can use CDN
+ security:
  since API and Web server are separate, not vulnerable to SQL injection or server-side code injection attacks ???
  Managed Web Server (e.g. CDN) is more up-to-date, stop DDOS attacks, etc.
+ development:
  front end is separate from back end, needs to access API only, not know server scripting language
