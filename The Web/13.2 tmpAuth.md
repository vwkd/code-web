# Authentication

[TOC]


<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction

- verification of identity
- beware: don't confuse with authorization, see Authorization ❗️
- must be done with each request since HTTP is stateless
??? today uses almost always HTML form-based authentication



## Manual authentication



gets an identifier, works as temporary password, everyone that has it can use it (as long as it's valid)
may be in form of cookie, or token



### Session / Cookie based

difference to HTTP auth
- uses own login, manual login

(HTML form-based authentication)

- sends credentials on first request, symmetric key in `Cookie` request header for subsequent request
- server can redirect to login page where submits form with credentials, redirects back if successful else stays on same page
- server stores symmetric key and sets it as cookie in UA
- UA authenticates silently on subsequent requests until cookie expires

![request flow for HTML form-based authentication](static/authhtml.svg)

- needs one more roundtrip for redirect to login page
beware: uses `200` instead `401` on failure, needs to communicate failure in content of login page

- advantages:
advanced, because needs custom login page, e.g. appearance, validation, multiple factors, etc.
custom, because request can send any way that wants, e.g. form action, AJAX, etc.
controllable, because website can invalidate session after duration
cheap, because server only needs to validate session on subsequent request instead of computing authentication (hashes, etc.)

- disadvantages:
advanced, because needs custom login page, e.g. keep redirect target (e.g. in server session, hidden field in login form, etc.), secure, etc.
complex, because needs to keep state, session list on server and session token client
long, because needs additional roundtrip for redirect to login page
attackable, because login details visible to webpage instead of only to UA, e.g. JS can read out form data

- beware: only ever use over HTTPS to verify identity ⚠️

#### Cookie

token is a symmetric key
needs to be secured

session ID is identifier associated with a user account
stored on server and client, client sends on request, server validates
server can delete session ID at any time, invalidates session

creates session, entry in database, with ID and user information
sends ID to client as cookie

stored in memory on server
might grow large for large amount of users

##### 1st idea

symmetric key = session ID
for successful server generates session ID with short lifetime
sets cookie to session ID (or derivate of it)
risky
  - the longer the lifetime the more time attacker has to hijack it
  - can use on multiple clients at once, attacker can just reuse
problem: how to stay logged in for longer

Idle / Inactivity Timeout: amount of time a session remains active since last activity
Absolute Timeout: amount of time a session remains active since creation

##### 2nd idea

for successful server generates session ID with short lifetime
sets cookie to session ID (or derivate of it)
periodically (e.g. or even for each request), regenerates session ID (if current one is successful)
-> user invalidates attackers session for every new page that visits

but attacker can impersonate user as long as user itself doesn't use session
if user returns is logged out if attacker used its session
?? how does user invalidate attacker session, generates another session with login instead of invalidating attackers one...

#### 3rd idea

login generates session ID, private to server
generate random token, based on session ID

??? cookie is random token that references session ID, not session ID itself
beware: cookie is symmetric key, shortlived but still key
has two cookies
  one session cookie, that changes with every request if previous one was valid, otherwise fixation attack ?? needs also short duration on server
  one persistent cookie (earlier was manual through "remember me" checkbox, nowadays automatically set ??!?!), that is used in new session (when no session cookie), has additional factos of validation, e.g. same device (UA etc.), same location (IP etc.)
?? beware: the longer the duration of the persistent cookie, the higher risk through XSS or XSRF because time that's vulnerable after last visit increases
  time period an attacker can launch attacks over active sessions
server should limit amount of simultaneously active sessions per user

password change must invalidate all open sessions
other role changes as well
needs new session ID

renews session cookie on every visit, unauthenticated or not, with short lifetime
  ?? but needs to keep history of all past session cookie chain ??
beware: uses term session cookie, although is technically persistent cookie !

- cookie has `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flag
make `SameSite: Lax` if possible (when page isn't embedded in other websites, needs cookie only for cross-origin requests due to top-level navigation, e.g. link)
or make even two cookies with Lax for read, and Strict for write access
  use two authentication cookies, one with `Lax` for read-only permission, one with `Strict` for read-and-write permission

beware: relies on cookie being sent with every request (?? same-origin), see HTTP cookie

### Token based auth

differences to cookie based auth
- uses own header, manual transmission
- uses own storage, manual session storage

like cookie based auth, but
token is username signed by server
  no need for server to store symmetric key

token can also contain authorization

client stores token, e.g. local storage
  could store in cookie as well, but would loose flexibility
sends token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, or URL, or POST body
-> gives up attributes of cookie, e.g. scope, HttpOnly, ??duration
need to use local storage instead of session storage, otherwise token won't persist accross tabs
but needs to delete manually on logout, since doesn't expire on own

??? what is advantage over cookie, just includes signed permissions, but nothing special otherwise
but if statless on server then can't invalidate

client needs to include token manually in every request, not like cookie which browser includes automatically
-> CSRF safe

token include authorization, since signed can't tamper

stateless on server ?? HOW CAN SERVER THEN KNOW WHICH TOKEN IS INVALID ??
takes all tokens as valid if not expired
can't invalidate tokens !!
-> can scale easier, no need to keep session store in sync, scales better

adv:
  - full control, client can decide when (not) to send, e.g. multiple domains, not by default -> CSRF safe
  - scale, because stateless on server
  - manual submission, not relied on cookie functionality, e.g. can use on native apps
cons:
  - bad duration, either too short or too long
  - no invalidation, website can't delete remotely, only on client
  - XSS, since local storage can be accessed by JS
  - needs JS, not send in HTML, e.g. image tag to protected URL, etc.

--> put token into cookie, uses cookie only for storage properties, ignores `Cookie` header on server, includes it manually in `Auth..` header still just like if it were stored in local storage

often used for APIs, e.g. SPAs, native apps

### Login page

login page should have no external dependencies that can be manipulated, otherwise XSS risk, e.g. 3rd party libraries
must use HTTPS, also on rest of site from where links to login page otherwise fake login page
login page should be rate limited increasingly
login page should use CSP, i.e. only execute signed scripts
should include anti CSRF token in form ???

Block IPs, not accounts
Challenge accounts with CAPTCHAs.

### Future auth

on signup, server generates public-private keypair for client, gives client private key, stores clients public key
?? how make signup secure
login as always, but client submits signature of random string received from server beforehand instead of a password, server uses clients public key to decrypt it
  authorize if successful
-> never transmits password itself
  but still needs to input it on page, which generates the signature
-> server doesn't stores (hash of) password, just public key
  ?? more complex to find private key to public key vs breaking a strong hash with salt

could also do with HTTP auth, browser would need to cache private key

user would need to use password manager since private key unmemorisable
  user must never need to type in by hand
  needs password manager universably accessible, since normal password can be stored in own memory
  -> no password manager is that accessible

?!?! can do all in JS without pages as well

## Identity management

Password strength requirements
Encourage entropy over patterns, discourage common passwords

Never store plaintext passwords, only hashed with salt
use slow hash, multiple iterations, the slower the better 
use unique salt

Don’t use security questions, insecure

don't do manually, best practices continually evolve
difficult to do right and keep updated, consider third party service, e.g. Auth0, Orka, etc.

<!-- todo: from Web Security, integrate... -->
- use OAuth with identity provider instead of own solution in first place
- transmit password, compute salted hash on server, compare to stored hash
- store only salted hash, never password itself
- require password strength, use Unicode characters, don't require composition rules but overall entropy, check against breached passwords, don't allow special words (e.g. website name, website URL, username, email, etc.)
- don't leak implementation, e.g. password reset form shouldn't tell if user is registered or not, response time should take same time if in/valid, i.e. hash password even if invalid, etc.
- provide and encourage multi-factor authentication
- rate limit login page increasingly on failure, e.g. 1 every 5s, 50 times a day, etc.
- use session IDs, destroy periodically, regenerate after login



## API

use `Authorization` header
?? WHY NOT COOKIE
-> because not every client may be an UA, may not have cookies, e.g. native app, etc.

API doesn't do authentication, just checks that authenticated
- beware: don't implement login / signup methods as part of API itself, makes API target of attack, use separate auth server, e.g. stricter rate limit, etc.

e.g. GitHub API
must get token from somewhere else, e.g. ??
- read token from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header


- trade it for a user if valid, otherwise set user to `null`


can use HTML form-based auth if it's accessed in UA, because sends cookie with every request, needs to provide
needs mechanism to forward to login page when makes unauthenticated request, e.g. fetch handler checks for error of 401, shows error message and forwards to login page, fowards back to previous position when done
is good idea to use `Cookie` instead of `Authorization` header ???


uses nowadays tokens instead of cookies ?!?!

/////

- traditionally used a secret key
- modern way is using OAuth 2.0

## API keys

- never hardcode into source code, instead use environment variables
- can set environment variables
  - remotely: save in UI, e.g. GitHub, Netlify, etc.
  - locally (single use): provide as command-line arguments
  - locally (multiple use): create `.env` file that's excluded from VCS with keys, write script that loads content and sets environment variables, e.g. `dotenv` module
- beware: always document required environment variables, e.g. create `sample.env` that's not excluded from VCS with sample keys ❗️
- beware: on client has no environment variables, needs to use proxy server that does request on its behalf, e.g. FaaS ❗️
<!-- How to limit access to proxy server to only come from instances of the web page ?? CAN'T ?!?! just within UA can limit using CORS but no guarantees from manual clients like curl ?? Could require a cookie set by the page, but that could be generated by an attacker as well and sent via curl, !! CAN WITH AUTHENTICATION -->


<!-- OLD OLD OLD -->

## HTTP authorization

- `403 Forbidden` response if authenticated correctly but not authorized ❗️
?!?! may read user from `Authorization` header or cookie
