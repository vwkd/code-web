# Session

[TOC]


<!-- todo: remove "Session" prefix -->

## Introduction

- a stateful information exchange
- start is called "login", end is called "logout"
- beware: often uses as synonym for session duration or session state ❗️
- since HTTP is stateless needs to keep state manually over multiple request-response cycles
- beware: if HTTP had been stateful wouldn't have needed to keep session state manually ❗️
- can use to keep any state, e.g. shopping cart, localization, auth, etc.
- beware: here treats session as sensitive, try to prevent session hijacking ❗️
- goal is to maximise session duration but minimise security risk
- beware: here covers only client, e.g. no native app where no cookies but also no XSS attacks, etc. ❗️
<!-- todo: maybe cover above?! -->


## Idea

- server creates session state
- server sends identifier of session to client
- client sends identifier with subsequent requests to server
- server personalizes request for client based on identifier



## Problem HTTP

- since HTTP is stateless, can't distinguish requests from two distinct connections (want to use token for doing just that)
- attacker can use identifier on different connection
- can't block based on metadata of request, since varies naturally, e.g. IP address
- can't block based on content of request, since can be faked, e.g. User-Agent
<!-- todo: refer to solution using Token Binding and/or client TLS certificates ?! 15 ?! -->


<!-- todo: clarify that server-side session, include client-side session as well, e.g. encrypt + sign cookie, however can't revoke, also shorter lifetime since higher risk of stealing -->

## Session state

- data on server
can be stored on server or client
usually stores on server for small scale, on client for large scale
- usually tied to a user, but may be anonymous
- contains metadata about request, e.g. lifetime, IP address, User-Agent string, role, user ID, last login, etc.
- can store in memory or on disk
- if stored on disk, encrypt data if sensitive, or at least store only hash of session ID, e.g. MD5 since already random, otherwise attacker can use all active sessions with theft of database

### Server-side

store data on server
send down only reference token
beware: don't use self-contained token since doesn't make sense

- advantages:
    - revocable, because server stores validity
    - low bandwith, because contains only identifier
    - secure, because user info is stored on server
- disadvantages:
    - not scalable, because server keeps state

### Client-side

store data on client
send down self-contained token, encrypted and signed
beware: don't use reference token since has no server-side state that can reference, state is in token itself

beware: don't confuse with client-side data that never reaches server, e.g. banner dismissed

- advantages:
    - scalable, because server doesn't keep state
- disadvantages:
    - not revocable, because server doesn't store validity
    - high bandwith, because contains state itself
    - insecure, because user info is stored on client
    


## Session token
<!-- todo: clarify BEARER token -->

- identifier of session
- unique, random, long, otherwise attacker can guess or bruteforce
- beware: temporary credentials to session, treat like a password, weaker than MFA since no additional factor necessary ⚠️
- opaque to client, only transparent to server
<!-- todo: is below true?
might want to update session state from client, e.g. put another shoe into shopping basket
-->
- reference token
- beware: don't use self-contained token, since higher bandwith and leaks user info to client ⚠️

### Token rotation

- switch token for new token
- server needs to store old tokens
- if old token is used, knows that attacker obtained one of them (either attacker or client has current one), revoke session
<!-- todo: limits time attacker can use session while user is using it -->
beware: doesn't prevent theft, only limits use



## Session lifetime

- duration of validity
- absolute timeout: lifetime after first use, not sliding with use, i.e. limits time attacker can use session after stolen -->
- idle timeout: lifetime after last use, sliding with use, idle timeout < absolute timeout, i.e. limits time attacker can steal session after login
- lifetime is timeout that ends earlier
- after lifetime expires, revoke session
<!-- todo: how to implement?
1. check each session with each request, delete session that have become invalid -> expensive
    actually only needs to check before using a session, others don't care, but once in a while needs to check all for clean up to not leak memory, e.g. rate of checking ~= rate of memory usage (when memory usage increases, so does checking rate, bound above by check on every request, otherwise would do more checks than requests, needless)
2. schedule deletion, need to update schedule if idle timeout shifts -> difficult, updated timer must not leak memory, what if request accesses session at exactly the time that other thread deletes it?, race conditions...
 -->



## Session revocation

- server deletes session, token on client becomes useless
- revoke session if User-Agent string changes, although good attacker can circumvent



## Implementation ?? SERVER

- allow user to revoke current session, e.g. logout button
- allow user to see all active sessions, e.g. IP address, User-Agent string, login time, last use time
- allow user to revoke any one or all active sessions
- on login send alert to user on trusted channel (e.g. email) with option to revoke
- implement admin "revoke all" feature to revoke all sessions of all users in case of breach
- log invalid tokens, block IP addresses same as for invalid usernames, see Login Page#???
- log session lifecycle, e.g. creation, renewal, destruction, login, logout, timeout, privilege change, invalid token, etc.
- beware: log only salted hash of token, otherwise leaks token in log ⚠️
- beware: set correct caching for personalised resources, otherwise exist even after logout, don't cache token, see HTTP cache ❗️



## Token transmission

<!-- different for type of client, e.g. browser, native app -->

<!-- cookie header, other header, body -->

- use cookies, otherwise XSS-attackable


## Token storage

<!-- different for type of client, e.g. browser, native app -->

<!-- cookie, web storage -->

don't leak implementation details, e.g. cookie name is `PHPSESSID`, better use `SID`

if cookies disabled, show notice that requires use of cookies
