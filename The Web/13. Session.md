# Session

[TOC]



## Introduction

- a stateful information exchange
- start is called "login", end is called "logout"
- usually tied to a user, but may be anonymous
- beware: often uses as synonym for session duration or session state ❗️
- since HTTP is stateless needs to keep state manually over multiple request-response cycles
- beware: if HTTP had been stateful wouldn't have needed to manually send a deputy identifier ❗️
- session state can be used for anything, e.g. analytics, localization, auth, personalization, etc.
- beware: here treats session as sensitive, try to prevent session hijacking ❗️
- goal is to maximise session duration but minimise security risk
- beware: don't confuse with data that's stored on client-side and never sent to server, e.g. banner dismissed, etc. ❗️



## Session state

- can store session state on server or client

### Server

- can store in memory or on disk
- if stored on disk, encrypt data if sensitive, or at least store only hash of session ID, e.g. MD5 since already random, otherwise attacker can use all active sessions with theft of database

### Client

- stored with token, see Token flow



## Session token

- deputy identifier of session
- unique, random, long, otherwise attacker can guess or bruteforce
- beware: temporary credentials to session, treat like a password, weaker than MFA since no additional factor necessary ⚠️
- opaque to client, only transparent to server

### Reference token

- stateful, identifier of session state on server
- use for session state that is stored on server
- advantages:
    - revocable, because server stores validity
    - low bandwith, because contains only identifier
    - secure, because client doesn't have access to state
- disadvantages:
    - not scalable, because server keeps state
- use for small-scale server

#### Rotation

- switch token for new token
- server needs to store old tokens
- if old token is used, knows that attacker obtained one of them (either attacker or client has current one), revoke session, i.e. limits time attacker can use session while user is using it
- beware: doesn't prevent theft itself, only limits use and alerts ⚠️

#### Lifetime

- time after which session is revoked
- absolute timeout: lifetime after first use, not sliding with use, i.e. limits time attacker can use session token after stolen
- idle timeout: lifetime after last use, sliding with use, idle timeout < absolute timeout, i.e. limits time attacker can steal session token after login
- lifetime is timeout that ends earlier

## Revocation

- server deletes session, token on client becomes useless
- revoke session if User-Agent string changes, although good attacker can circumvent

### Self-contained token

- stateless, encrypted and signed session state itself
- use for session state that is stored on client
- advantages:
    - scalable, because server doesn't keep state
- disadvantages:
    - not modifiable, because server can't change, e.g. fixed lifetime
    - not revocable, because server doesn't store validity
    - high bandwith, because contains state itself
    - insecure, because client has access to state (even if encrypted)
- use for large-scale server



## Session token flow

- server creates session state
- server sends session token to client
- client sends session token to server on subsequent requests
- beware: if storage is disabled, show notice that requires use of storage ❗️
- beware: don't leak server implementation details, e.g. token storage name `SID` instead of `PHPSESSID` ❗️

### Cookie

- client receives, stores, and sends token as cookie
- advantages:
    - no work, since cookie is stored and sent automatically, e.g. no need to implement CRUD, etc.
    - no JS, since cookies are built into browser
    - XSS safe, since cookie can't be accessed by JS (if proper `HttpOnly` flag is set!)
- disadvantages:
    - no control, since cookie is sent always
    - CSRF attackable, since cookie is sent automatically with each request
    - not universal, since cookies are built into browser only
- use for client that's only websites

### Custom

- client receives, stores, and sends token in custom way, e.g. receives in header or body, stores in Web Storage API or cookie, sends in header or body or URL, etc.
- beware: don't send token in URL, since leaks information, e.g. bookmarks, shared URL, logs, etc. ⚠️
- advantages:
    - control, since token is sent manually
    - (browser only) CSRF safe, since token is sent only on manual requests
    - universal, since functionality exists on any platform, e.g. native apps
- disadvantages:
    - work, since not stored and sent automatically, e.g. needs to implement CRUD (not "D" if cookie), etc.
    - (browser only) JS only, since functionality is custom, e.g. storage, request, etc.
    - (browser only) XSS attackable, since storage must be accessible by JS
- Web Storage allows access only from same domain, not from any subdomain
- can use cookie purely for storage, server ignores cookie itself, wastes bandwith since sends token twice, but accessible on all subdomains
- use for client that's not only website, e.g. native app



## Logging

- log invalid tokens, flag IP addresses same as login throttling with invalid usernames, see Login Page
- log session lifecycle, e.g. creation, renewal, destruction, login, logout, timeout, privilege change, invalid token, etc.
- beware: log only salted hash of token, otherwise leaks token in log ⚠️
- beware: set correct caching for personalised resources, otherwise exist even after logout, don't cache token, see HTTP cache ❗️



 ## Problem with Bearer Tokens
 <!-- todo: where does this belong? -> Definition of token itself. Where is it? Auth? But then circular references...? -->

- server can't distinguish requests from two distinct connections since HTTP is stateless (for exactly that wants to use bearer token)
- attacker can use bearer token on different connection without server knowing
- server can't identify based on metadata of request, since can vary naturally, e.g. IP address, time, etc.
- server can't identify based on content of request, since can be faked, e.g. User-Agent, etc.
- needs to use asymmetric encryption, e.g. TLS client certificates, Token Binding, etc.
