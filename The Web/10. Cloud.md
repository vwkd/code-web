## Introduction

- on-demand shared computer resources
- on network of remote servers on the Internet
- provider maintains physical infrastructure, e.g. reliability, scalability, security, performance, etc.
- beware: misnomer, "it's just someone else's computer" ❗️



## Service models

- usually pay-per-time
idle time can be reduced drastically from IaaS to FaaS

### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

- provision of virtual infrastructure, e.g. processing, storage, networks, etc.
- provider manages physical infrastructure
- e.g. Google Compute Engine

### Platform as a service (PaaS)

- provision of a platform, e.g. operating system
- provider manages infrastructure
- e.g. Google App Engine

### Software as a service (SaaS)

???
- provision of an application, e.g. database, runtime, etc.
- provider manages platform and infrastructure

### Function as a service (FaaS)

- provision of code execution environment, e.g. ???
- provider manages the software, platform and infrastructure
- e.g. Google Cloud Functions

- triggered by events, e.g. HTTP API, connected services, etc.
- beware: often time limit on execution before is stopped, e.g. 5 minutes, etc.
- beware: also called "serverless" because server is abstracted away completely, although there is still a server ❗️

declaratively establishes relationships between individual functions of what otherwise would have been a single server
can use to disassemble server into its individual functions, each becomes independently scalable, no idle time
no idle time

can use for back-end HTTP API



## Examples of ??

- CMS: Netlify CMS, etc.
- image hosting: Cloudinary, etc.
- comments: Disqus, etc.
- contact form: Formcarry, Netlify Forms, etc.
