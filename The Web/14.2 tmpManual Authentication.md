express-session

?? each kind of session has a name, stored internally as a list over all requests, automatically finds entry for a request which already has a cookie

in-memory object with names as keys, that's why each cookie object is given a name to be able to find it later
also adds signature to cookie that's send so tampering is detected ?? Why, because session ID is already random, manipulation is useless ?!?!?!
can also let server sign cookie
?? WHY? what difference does it make to send the session ID directly unsigned? Attacker can't guess it either, since random
