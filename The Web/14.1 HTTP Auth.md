# HTTP auth

[TOC]



## Introduction

- for direct access
- for user-to-machine and machine-to-machine communication
- beware: bad naming choices containing "authorization" and "authentication", e.g. header names, status codes, etc.



## U2M

### Access flow

- send credentials in `Authorization` request header of each request
- server can challenge client to provide authentication
- UA gives popup for user name and password
- UA usually caches credentials and authenticates silently on subsequent requests
- website has no way to control credential caching in UA, e.g. for which domains or paths, duration of cache, etc.
- beware: credential caching is convenience feature individual to a UA, not mandated or regulated by any spec ⚠️

![request flow for HTTP authentication](static/httpauth.svg)

- response header: `WWW-Authenticate: <type> realm=<realm>`
- request header: `Authorization: <type> <credentials>`
- `401 Unauthorized` status code if authenticated incorrectly
- if proxy server, instead uses `407 Proxy Authentication Required` response with `Proxy-Authenticate` response header and `Proxy-Authorization` request header
- `403 Forbidden` status code if authenticated correctly but not authorized
- advantages:
  - simple, because no login page
  - easy, because no need for session on server or client
- disadvantages:
  - simple, because no login page, e.g. appearance, descriptions, multiple steps / factors, etc.
  - permanent, because website can't invalidate session
  - expensive, because needs to re-authenticate on every request
  - phishable, since identity of server is not verified, e.g. MITM, phishing URLs, etc.

### Type `Basic`

- credentials is encoding of `<username>:<password>`, e.g. base64
- username and password may not contain colons, otherwise not clear what's username and password on server after decoding
- beware: credentials are neither encrypted nor authenticated, only ever use over HTTPS ⚠️
- previously UAs allowed to specify credentials alternatively in `userinfo` field of URL besides popup field, didn't need to wait for challenge from server, but deprecated due to phishing URLs, e.g. `http://google.com:search@evil.com`

### Type `Digest`

- credentials is hash of `<username>:<password>`, e.g. SHA256, MD5, etc.
- uses nonce to give originality, otherwise attacker can just replay hash
- beware: over HTTPS has no benefit over `Basic`, more expensive and more roundtrips ❗️



## M2M

- can use same as U2M, except that builds header itself instead of asking browser
- or use API keys
