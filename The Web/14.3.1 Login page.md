## Introduction

- 

- login, password, MFA
- keep session with UA, e.g. session cookie
- session management, e.g. revoke single session, revoke all
- user group




<!-- todo: below works only if AS and RS are on same domain! -->

## Features

- register
    password strength, stronger for admin users, educate about password managers
        high min and very high max, e.g. 12 to 64 or 128
        Unicode range
        check entropy instead of arbitrary rules
    check common and breached passwords, e.g. HIBP API
- email confirmation
- password reset
    don't leak if user exists or not, just "if account exists, we sent email"
    don't reset if email is not confirmed!!!
    no security questions, since basically weaker password, insecure
    store hash of reset token, not token itself, otherwise database theft gets free password resets
- account deletion

- allow admin to force password change, don't log in until password is changed
- allow MFA, don't log in until MFA is put in
- verify email, don't log in until verified
-> can use a session with no roles, such that can access account, but can't do anything else until confirmed email

- rate limit on all routes, esp. /login, return 429 with helpful error message
attacks: can either throttle login to specific account or by specific IP address, or to all accounts / by any IP address
    single-machine bfa on many accounts with single password => easy, IP throttling
    single-machine bfa on single accounts with many passwords => easy, IP throttling
    distributed bfa on many accounts with single password => hard, global throttling, when global login failure rate increases too fast
    distributed bfa on single accounts with many passwords => easy, username throttling
    => always impedes legitimate users, since by assumption can't discern legitimate users from bot without captcha
same IP different usernames => throttle IP
same IP same username multiple times => throttle IP, throttle username
multiple IPs same username => throttle username, throttle IPs
send users notifications they logged in per email, with link to say "wasn't me"
    then can block IPs targeted
beware: don't block IPs permanently, otherwise infected user machine is also blocked, instead block increasingly, e.g. 2^x days with max. 32 days
beware: don't lock accounts, otherwise attacker locks all accounts using DDOS
beware: don't use CAPTCHAS, since evil against humans, inaccessible, etc. rather accept tiny fraction of bot attempts 

motivate MFA

log all attempts, logins, failures, etc.

- rotate token when user data changes, e.g. password change, role change, etc.




## BEARER Token

## Token types
<!-- todo: see reference token in 13.3 -->

- token can be stateful or stateless (of AS!, and therefore RS tightly or loosely coupled)

### reference token

token = session ID
use when AS = RS, RS can just lookup session, take infos from session directly
key itself that is mapped to user in session list

AS creates session data from user, random session ID, 
     {sessionId, userId, role, loginAttempts, expires}
usually uses in-memory storage
    if crashes kills sessions
    periodically needs to purge expired sessions, otherwise memory leak

adv:
    - low bandwith, since only identifier
    - private, since doesn't contain user identifying information that client could read
    - revocable, since RS needs to contact AS, e.g. logout, role change, password reset, etc.
disadv:
    - storage (stateful), since AS needs to keep session state, although usually always keeps session state
    (- RS can't verify token itself) ONLY IMPORTANT IF AS != RS
        -> doesn't scale

### self-contained token

token = self-contained token, signed JWT
use when AS != RS, RS can't just lookup session, with session ID would need to send to AS with every request, would be tight coupling, instead contain info directly in token
-> can't revoke token without making stateful again, use primarily for long-lived information, e.g. userID

adv:
    - storage (stateless), since AS doesn't need to keep session state, although usually always keeps session state
    (- RS can verify token itself) ONLY IMPORTANT IF AS != RS
        -> scales
disadv:
    - high bandwith, since contains user data
    - not private, since contains user identifying information that client could read
    - not revocable, since RS doesn't need to contact AS, e.g. logout, role change, password reset, etc.
    


## Token transmission

receives in header or body
sends in header always
don't send in URL, may be shared, bookmarked, etc.
    e.g. API keys are bad if in URL

### Custom header

in `Authorization` header, manually
can choose any storage: memory, Web Storage, even cookies

- server sends symmetric key as token, in body
- client sends it in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` request header, on own requests
- usually token, but not necessarily
- stored in custom storage, e.g. Web storage
DON'T USE WEB STORAGE TO STORE KEY!!! XSS!!!
 instead use memory + refresh token in cookie

- often used for SPAs (since written in JS)
and APIs who has clients that may not be browsers, i.e. no cookies

pros:
- manual, because needs custom request to include header, mitigates CSRF, e.g. multiple domains
- universal, because doesn't rely on cookie functionality, e.g. native apps

cons:
- Web storage, needs to store manually, e.g. setting, deleting, etc.
- JS only, because needs custom request to include header
- XSS attackable, since uses JS and Web storage
- doesn't work for sub-domains, since Web storage is only on exact domain

- can also use cookie for storage instead of Web storage because accessible on all subdomains, as before but just loads from cookie instead of Web storage, server ignores cookie in requests, wastes bandwith by including twice as cookie



/////////////////////////////////////

## App

sends credentials directly to endpoint
does verification
returns token in body of 200 OK


## storage

store however

beware: on any device can extract token if has access to device, e.g. browser extension, outside browser, etc.
- beware: client storage isn't secure, can always extract key while it's there


////////////////////////////////////

## Storing user data

only store user data you actually need, the less you have the less can be stolen, e.g. nobody needs "favorite color", etc.

store hash + salt passwords, never plaintext!
    Argon2id, bcrypt, or PBKDF2
    as slow as possible to slow down attacker, but not too slow to be unusable on login verification, usually less than 1s
    needs to increase work factor over time
    use unique salt
submit plaintext password, verify hash on server against database
    don't hash on client, since then hash itself becomes the password which is stored in cleartext in database, i.e. stealing database means you can log in directly
may add pepper, private secret on server-side in every hash function, but difficult to store, difficult to rotate, etc.
    -> better just encrypt hash, encryption key is pepper, this way can de/encrypt easily and transition

username is case-insensitive, store as lowercase
    unique

/////////////////////////////////

## Passwords

- long
- random, no dictionary words, no personal data, e.g. name, birthday, etc.
- unique, never reuse twice
- store securely, otherwise pointless, e.g. password manager, not browser, etc.
- use securely, otherwise pointless, e.g. phishing website, browser extension that reads form fields, key logger, shoulder-surfing, etc.
- use MFA, another layer in case PW is stolen, e.g. TOTP, not SMS, etc.

////////////////////////////////

## Session state

- contains metadata about request, e.g. lifetime, IP address, User-Agent string, role, user ID, last login, etc.

- if session state is auth, uses `Authorization` header
<!-- todo: there was more to it, see Login page -->

## Implementation

- allow user to revoke current session, e.g. logout button
- allow user to see all active sessions, e.g. IP address, User-Agent string, login time, last use time
- allow user to revoke any one or all active sessions
- on login send alert to user on trusted channel (e.g. email) with option to revoke
- implement admin "revoke all" feature to revoke all sessions of all users in case of breach



///////////////////////////
<!-- todo: from Web Security, integrate... -->
- use OAuth with identity provider instead of own solution in first place
- transmit password, compute salted hash on server, compare to stored hash
- store only salted hash, never password itself
- require password strength, use Unicode characters, don't require composition rules but overall entropy, check against breached passwords, don't allow special words (e.g. website name, website URL, username, email, etc.)
- don't leak implementation, e.g. password reset form shouldn't tell if user is registered or not, response time should take same time if in/valid, i.e. hash password even if invalid, etc.
- provide and encourage multi-factor authentication
- rate limit login page increasingly on failure, e.g. 1 every 5s, 50 times a day, etc.
- use session IDs, destroy periodically, regenerate after login

//////////////////////////

### Asymmetric credentials ???

use private-public key pair instead of password
server stores only public key

on signup, client generates public-private keypair, sends server its public key instead of a password, doesn't require a password

on login, server sends random string, client submits signature of random string with private key, server verifies that public key decrypts it

adv:
  - server doesn't store credentials, just public key, useless to breach ?? assumes more complex to find private key to public key than breaking a strong hash with salt
disadv:

?? how does public-private keypair store and transfer between UAs
?? in U2M should user input PPKP to login page, would need need to use password manager since keys unmemorisable
  user must never need to type in by hand
  needs password manager universably accessible, since normal password can be stored in own memory
  -> no password manager is that accessible
  if not, then does all in JS, invisible to user, NICE
