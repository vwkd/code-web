# Systems Design

[TOC]


## Introduction

- ??
concerned with scalability


## Terminology

throughput
latency


## Principles

- the simpler, the better
- don't scale early, unnecessary complexity


## Load balancing

- distribute traffic by machines according to load / area
- via Proxy server or DNS
- figure out which machines have little load or are offline


## Caching

- takes load of underlying system, e.g. database
- usually in memory ??
- e.g. Memcache, Redis, Casendra?
- duration, expiring


## CNDs

- for static files
- pull, slow only for first user, no wasted space
- push, fast even for first user, but wasted space


## Database

- type
- RLD: primary keys, etc.
- indexes for faster lookups
- first point of failure

### Replication

- master slave
- only master is written to, writes to slaves, all are read from
- consistency ?

### Sharding

- split into multiple masters
- vertical: put each table into different machine
- horizontal: split single table onto different machines


## HTTP API

- protocol buffers or JSON
- security
- offline
- performance


## Web application server

### Web server

- scale using duplication and load balancers

### Static file server

- CDNs

### Database

- caching
- replication
- indexing
