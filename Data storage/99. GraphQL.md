## Introduction


has a schema and static types


### Type system

<!-- todo: difference type system and schema ??? -->

description of what types of objects GraphQL implementation can return


By default, null is a permitted value for any type in GraphQL
  since fetching data to fulfill a GraphQL query often requires talking to different services that may or may not be available.
  if fetching fails, should it return null or throw an error ???
  ??? should only allow null if value can also be null in successful fetching !!??!! because every fetching can fail!!


a schema needs an object type that is the basis for all queries, entry point into the type system
  name of this type is `Query` by convention, not necessary though could name differently
  Query type is entry point for queries

beware: type is not object !!!
type name will resolve into property name of response object

```graphql
// schema

type Actor {
  id: String
  name: String
}
```

```graphql
// query

{
  actor {
    name
  }
}
```

??? why only one response object instead of array?? What is "actor" anyway??

```json
// response

{
  "actor": {
    "name": "Tom Hanks"
  }
}
```

by convention names types uppercase, fields lowercase ?!?!

can declare `type`, `interface`, `interface` can extend `type`, just like in TypeScript ??


beware: type system maps to underlying implementation, not necessarily database since can give whatever data back
types usually map to underlying database, but not necessary

### Query language

"query" corresponds to READ ??
beware: "query" is overloaded with "query" that transmits, like a request

"modify" corresponds to CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE ???
  query is like GET requests, while mutations operate like POST/PATCH/DELETE

query is shaped just like the data it returns (JSON)
but doesn't need values, also needs additional filter capabilities
beware: query is not JSON !!!

<!-- difference between selection set and object, field and property ??? -->

??? what specifies like an object is actually a "selection set", returns all objects that match that shape
fields are unordered

A field describes one discrete piece of information available to request within a selection set.
a field may itself contain a selection set, allowing for deeply nested requests.
  follow relationships between objects

Fields accept values: scalars, enumeration values, lists, or objects.
objects fields are unordered

operations: queries, mutations, and subscriptions
  query – a read‐only fetch.
  mutation – a write followed by a fetch.
  subscription – a long‐lived request that fetches data in response to source events.

An operation selects the set of information it needs

If a Document contains only one operation, that operation may be unnamed or represented in the shorthand form, which omits both the query keyword and operation name
If a document contains only one query operation, and that query defines no variables and contains no directives, that operation may be represented in a short‐hand form which omits the query keyword and query name.

operations must specify their selections down to fields which return scalar values to ensure an unambiguously shaped response.

Field can accept one or more named arguments, argument order is arbitrary

Field can be aliased, such that can query same field multiple times, e.g. with different arguments

A field’s response key is its alias if an alias is provided, and it is otherwise the field’s name.
by default: key in the response object will use the field name queried



can send multiple queries by "query NAME1 {...} query NAME2 {...}"

can query implicit fields ??? automatically generated, e.g. "__typename"
__schema field on the root type of a Query

```graphql
// query

query IntrospectionTypeQuery {
  __schema {
    types {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

??? underscorde in type name indicates type is part of the introspection system

beware: don't make circular nested queries, many calls to resolver function and underlying database ???

can use fragments to factor out duplicate code
also use if wants to conditionally apply using `on` ?? directive

### Language

<!-- todo: OLD, incorporate in other chapters -->

types: object, scalar, enum
objects have fields that can contain another type

in response will get array with all objects of that type, only with the fields specified

```graphql
// query

query {
  actor {
    name
  }
}
```

```json
// response

{
  "data": {
    "actor": [
      {
        "name": "Tom Hanks"
      },
      {
        "name": "Will Smith"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

beware: response data is in `"data"` property of a wrapper object ⚠️ ??!!!???

query returns something only if there is at least one field with a non-object value, e.g. like `name` above


returned data is JSON
objects, with fields that can have value string, array, or another object

can query for objects, gets *array of objects* with those fields, e.g.

```plaintext
{
  actor {
    name
  }
}
```

```plaintext
{
  "actor": [
    {
      "name": "Tom Hanks"
    },
    {
      "name": "Will Smith"
    }
  ]
}
```

beware: don't confuse with objects, specifies shape of object


defining types and fields on those types


## Validation

## Introspection


### Server

receives query
checks query against schema
runs relevant resolver functions
sends result

query is sent as a string

execute queries, fulfilling queries

resolver functions for each field, get the data
providing functions for each field on each type


Fields are functions which return values
arguments alter behavior

### Client

send queries and handle responses
caching responses, but not only identical ones, also partial matching data
validation and optimization of queries based on the schema

e.g. apollo-client, relay
