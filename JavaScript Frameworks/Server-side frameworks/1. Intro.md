# Web application framework

[TOC]


## Introduction

<!-- todo: fix Intro, C&P from 6. HTTP Server -->
- abstracts away the underlying HTTP server to build a `TCP` connection, e.g. `http` module in Node
- exposes an API to declaratively handle requests and responses
- facilitates the tasks above as much as possible
- beware: should have been called "Web service framework", just framework on top of HTTP server
- almost always want to use a Web application framework, e.g. Express, Koa, etc. in Node
