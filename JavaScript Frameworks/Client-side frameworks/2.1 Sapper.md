## Introduction

mixture of
  - static site generator
  - server-side "rendering" (as opposed to pure Svelte client-side "rendering")
  - intelligent preloading
  - ???
--> developer tool instead of framework

- Server-Side Rendering: doesn't send empty HTML and Svelte JavaScript runtime generates DOM, but ready HTML with only minimal JavaScript to make interactive
- but still client side routing, preloading
- can export as static side, doesn't need custom Web server, e.g. Koa
actually just needs custom Web server for API endpoints !!!
