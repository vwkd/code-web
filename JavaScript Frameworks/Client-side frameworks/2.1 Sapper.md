## Introduction

- static site generator for server-side rendered, server-side routed website ??

server-side "rendering", (as opposed to pure Svelte client-side "rendering") ??? IMPLIED ALREADY SINCE SSG ?!?!
hydrates static HTML on client

--> developer tool instead of framework

beware: not a Web application framework that runs a Web server like Koa !!!

server-side rendering engine ???? OR static side generator ???
Express-compatible middleware


## On build

- template syntax ???
- file system based routing, each file is Svelte component
instead of code ??? server-side vs. client-side routing ?? 
- code-splitting for each route

## On client

- preloading of routes
intelligently on hover or keydown instead of keyup on link ???
