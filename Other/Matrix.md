## Introduction

- open network for secure decentralized real-time communication


“open standard for interoperable communication”
like SMTP for email, like PSTN for phone
can replace phone, email, messaging, video calls

“open protocol for secure decentralised communication”

decentralised data store
JSON messages


E2E encryption by default

“open standard for secure, decentralised, real-time communication”

“open decentralised pubsub layer for the internet for securely persisting and publishing/subscribing JSON objects”

can use over any transport, usually HTTP

events
event graph, directed acyclic graph (DAG)

over the Internet

exchanges blobs of JSON
real-time

/// FOSDEM 2019 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2eE7rCUKlE

set of HTTP APIs, protocol to send and receive real-time messages
openly federated global public network

pubsub protocol for JSON data

create a open decentralised encrypted real-time communication network

passes conversation history around, like Git commits, sync servers conversation history, not just passing bare messages
like Git, for JSON

pubsub framework for the Internet

///// FOSDEM 2021 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzUfS08lMek

“open protocol for secure decentralised real-time communication”

replicates information across nodes like Git

replace Email, replace phone
liberate communication from companies

/// Matrix FAQ

open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP / over the Internet

fix fragmented IP communications, message / call without having to care what app the receipient is on, as easy as sending an email.

data synchronisation system for the whole web

eventually consistent global JSON database with an HTTP API and pubsub semantics

an open interoperable communication standard

interoperable communications tools
service providers compete on quality of service, security and features, rather than being closed

//// https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/311

open federated object database with realtime pubsub semantics

like Git, but for realtime data

openly federated JSON database
