# Introduction

## JavaScript

- just-in-time compiled object oriented scripting language

- dynamic typing, prototype-based inheritance, first-class functions

- client-side JS runs in browser, uses Web APIs

  control behavior of Web pages, neither structure nor appearance

- server-side JS runs in runtime environment, e.g. Node.js

  control server

- standard language is called ECMAScript (ES), "JavaScript" is trademark of Oracle, has no relation with Java except historic name to attract popularity

- file extension .js



## Syntax

- case sensitive
- uses Unicode charset, e.g. Umlaute are allowed
- semicolon after each statement, not mandatory since interpreter infers missing ones from line break, but leaving out may lead to unexpected errors line break was unintended
- whitespace is ignored, only for readability, space, tab, newline, comments get converted to whitespace on interpretation
- single-line comments `//`, multi-line comments `/*...*/`
- statements get interpreted in order of appearance



## Identifier

- sequence of characters to identify variable, function, property, etc.
- can contain letters, digits, _, \$, can not start with digit, convention is to not use _ or \$ as they are used by external modules
- cannot be keyword, e.g. `true`, `var`, `function`, `if`, `return`, etc.
- convention is to use lower camelCase for variables functions, properties, and upper CamelCase for constructors and classes
- case sensitive



## Variables

- named reference of storage address in memory
- can be declared and initialised

### Declaration

- single: `keyword identifier;`

- multiple: `keyword identifier1, identifier2;`
- non-initialised variables are automatically initialised to `undefined` ‚ùóÔ∏è

### Initialization

- single: `identifier = value;`
- multiple: `identifier1 = identifier2 = value;`

### Declaration and initialization

- single: `keyword identifier = value;`
- multiple: `keyword identifier1, identifier2 = value;`

### Variable types

#### `var` üëé

- global variable, only respects function scope
- if not initialised is automatically initialised to `undefined`
- can be accessed before declaration with value `undefined`

#### `let` üëç

- local variable, respects function and block scope
- if not initialised is automatically initialised to `undefined`
- can not be accesseed until declaration, temporary death zone

#### `const` üëç

- local variable, respects function and block scope

- must be initialised when declared, cannot be reassigned

  (since pointer stays the same array and object content can still be changed)

### Scope

- region where variable can be referenced
- global: in whole document
- local: in block `{...}` where it was declared, e.g. if statement

- if a variable declared in inner scope has same name as a existing variable in outer scope, it "shadows" it

  ```javascript
  var x = 42;
  (function() {
    var x = 21;
    console.log(x); // 21
  }());
  console.log(x) // 42
  ```

### Hoisting

- before code is executed, variable declarations and function declarations are processed first into a memory "dictionary" for containing scope

- practically looks as if declarations were moved to top of containing scope, "hoisted"

- declaration but not initialisation is hoisted‚ùóÔ∏è

- declaration is hoisted even if it would never be executed, e.g. because it's inside a non-true if statement, etc.‚ùóÔ∏è

- var is hoisted with value of `undefined`, as if it was declared with `var identifier` on top of containing scope

  ```javascript
  // normal declaration, automatic initialisation of undefined
  var x;
  console.log(x); // undefined
  
  // as if "var x;" was hoisted to top, has value undefined
  x = 3;
  console.log(x); // 3
  var x;
  
  // as if "var x;" was hoisted to top, has value undefined
  console.log(x); // undefined
  var x;
  
  // as if "var x;" was hoisted to top, has value undefined
  console.log(x); // undefined
  var x = 3;
  
  // as if "var x;" was hoisted to top of function scope, has value undefined
  var x = 42;
  (function() {
      console.log(x); // undefined
      var x = 21;
  }());
  ```

- function declarations are hosted in entirety with body, as as if it was declared on top of containing scope

- function declarations rule over variable declarations, but not variable initialisations

  ```javascript
  // as if "function y() {...};" was hoisted to top
  y(); // "Hello World!"
  function y() {console.log("Hello World!");};
  
  // as if "var y;" was hoisted to top, has value undefined
  y(); // TypeError: y is not a function
  var y = function() {console.log("Hello World!");};
  
  // function declaration rules over variable declaration but not variable initialisation
  function y() {}
  var y;
  alert(typeof y); // "function"
  var y = 42;
  alert(typeof y); // "number"
  
  // as if "function y() {...};" was hoisted to top
  y(); // "Hello World!"
  var y = 42;
  function y() {console.log("Hello World!");};
  ```

- let, const and classes are also hoisted to top of containing scope, but remain _without a value_ until the declaration (instead of `undefined`), "Temporal Death Zone", i.e. can't be read or assigned before declaration‚ùóÔ∏è

  ```javascript
  // normal declaration, automatic initialisation of undefined
  let x;
  console.log(x); // undefined
  
  // x exists but has no value, can't read or assign
  x = 3; // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
  console.log(x);
  let x;
  
  // x exists but has no value, can't read or assign
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
  let x;
  
  // x exists but has no value, can't read or assign
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
  let x = 3;
  
  // confirmation that let variables are really hoisted
  // if x wouldn't be hoisted it would log "42", but it "knows" of later declaration, because it is hoisted to top of function scope
  let x = 42;
  (function() {
    console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
    let x = 21;
  }());
  ```

- some challenges

  ```javascript
  var x = 42;
  (function() {
  	if (!x) {
  		var x = 21;
  	}
  	console.log(x); // 21
  }())
  // because x is hoisted to top of function with value undefined, the if statement executes
  
  var x = 42;
  (function() {
  	x = 10;
  	return;
  	function x() {}
  }())
  console.log(x); // 42
  // because x is hoisted as function declaration to top of function, it creates a seperate local x that is assigned 10, so the outer x is not changed
  
  if (!window.x) {
      var x = 42;
  }
  console.log(a); // undefined
  // as if "var x;" was hoisted to top, has value undefined, because window.x does exists, the if statement is not run
  ```
