# Strict Mode

[TOC]



## Introduction

- directive that changes behavior of JS
- attempt to correct bad design decisions and syntax
- throws more errors instead of silently ignoring mistakes
- allows for more optimization and security
- all new projects should use strict mode ‚ùóÔ∏è



## Enabling

- can either apply to global scope or function scope, not to block scope
- place `"use script";` at top of script / function
- only comments are allowed to come before
- since it's a string, it's ignored by incompatible browsers  
  beware: if code relies on different behavior in strict mode, might break on incompatible browsers ‚ö†Ô∏è
- contents of modules and classes use strict mode by default
- beware: combining multiple scripts where not all use strict mode into a single file could break things ‚ö†Ô∏è



## Changes

### New errors

- assignment to non-writable global variable, e.g. `NaN`, `undefined`, `Infinity`, etc.
- assignment to non-writable object property
- assignment to getter property of object
- creating new property on non-extensible object
- deleting non-configurable object property
- deleting variable or function
- setting an undeclared variable, (before a global variable was declared implicitly as if had used `var` in global scope)
- duplicate function parameters or object literal property names
- using the `callee` or `caller` property of the `arguments` object in a function
- using the `caller` or `arguments` property of a function object
- a number with zero as leading digit, to deprecate old octal syntax
- setting properties on primitive values
- using `with` keyword
- using more reserved keywords, e.g. `eval`, `arguments`, `private`, `static`, etc.

### New behavior

- function declarations are scoped to block instead of containing function, e.g. conditional function declarations are not implementation dependend anymore üéâ (initially in ES5 strict mode were only allowed at top-level of the scope, i.e. forbidden in if statement, for loop, etc., ES6 allowed again by introducing the scope limitation)

```javascript
"use strict";
if (true) {
  function x() {return 42;}
}
else {
  function x(){ return 21;}
}
x(); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

- `arguments` object doesn't alias function parameters anymore, i.e. changing one doesn't affect the other
- `eval` doesn't add variables to surrounding scope anymore, only accessible for code being evaluated
- `eval` evaluates code in strict mode as well
- `this` in a function is `undefined` by default instead of the global object, i.e. forgetting `new` keyword before constructor will not silently modify global object anymore üéâ
- `this` in a function called by `Function.prototype.apply`/`call()` is the actual value passed instead of it being wrapped as object, (before `null` and `undefined` were even wrapped as global object)
- the default value for `this` in `Function.prototype.apply`/`call()` is `undefined` instead of the global object
