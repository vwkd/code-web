# Programming Paradigms

[TOC]



## Introduction

- a fundamental programming style
- use to increase maintainability and minimize area where bugs can occur, e.g. through better readability, modularity, etc.
- a language can support multiple programming paradigms, is often characterized by it, e.g. "JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language"
- "programming style" itself refers to code style, e.g. formatting etc.
- most programming languages support imperative paradigm, that's the most usual style of code
- side effects: when an operation is dependent on state outside of the operation, e.g. on changing non-local variable, I/O, random numbers, other side effects, etc.



## Imperative Paradigm

- instructions _how_ to do an operation, doesn't explain _what_ it does e.g. order of single steps to compute result like a for loop
- explicit
- allow side effects



## Declarative

- instructions _what_ operation to do, not _how_ to do it
- implicit, hides uneccesary details
- eliminate or minimize side effects
