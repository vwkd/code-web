## Client-side JS

- JS is a scripting language, it tells its host environment what to do, by itself it can not interact with the computer

- the host environment needs to implement mechanisms for interacting with the computer, e.g. input / output, events, etc.

  see Browser APIs

- almost every computer has a JS interpreter - the browser - which makes JS one of the most popular programming languages in the world



## Types of client-side JS

### External üëç

- script in separate .js file

- reference .js in `<script>` element anywhere in `<html>` section

  ```html
  <script src="...js"></script>
  ```

- can omit `type` attribute since JS is default scripting language
- content must be empty if `src` attribute is present
- best practice, seperates JS from HTML

### Internal üëé

- script in .html file

- script in `<script>` element anywhere in `<html>` section

  ```html
  <script>...</script>
  ```

- not recommended, mixes JS with HTML

### Inline üëé

- script in .html file

- script in on`event` attribute of single HTML element

  ```html
  <tagname onevent="...">...</tagname>
  ```

- not recommended, mixes JS with HTML



## Load script

- script is loaded and executed at location in HTML
- problem: blocks page parsing and it can't access later content because it is not yet loaded
- primitive solution: put script at end after `<body>`
- modern solution: browser can load scripts async, even multiple at same time, but for execution needs to stop page load or wait until is done

- `async`: fetches script async, executes it as soon as loaded, possibly blocking page load, async scripts are executed in order of loading, what loads first runs first, good if script is independent from page and other scripts, e.g. ads, calculations, etc.

- `defer`: fetches script async, executes it after page load, defered scripts are executed in order of appearance, good for any dependent scripts

- code is run in order of appearance, like one big file, i.e. later variables can overwrite previous ones, has access to content of other scripts

- a script is limited to current browser tab



## Web APIs

- Application Programming Interface (API): particular set of rules that two software programs can follow to interact with each other, abstraction layer of underlying implementation
- Web API: client-side API

### Browser APIs

- interface to interact with browser and therefore the page
- usually provide JS objects with properties and methods, the constructor is called "interface"
- often constraint to security measures, e.g. permission request, URLs must be HTTPs, etc.

#### Common Browser APIs

- DOM, BOM, CSSOM: interact with page
- XMLHttpRequest, Fetch: downloading remote data
- Canvas, WebGL, requestAnimationFrame: draw, animate
- HTMLMediaElement, Web Audio, WebRTC: play media
- Geolocation, Notification, Vibration: device functions
- Web Storage, IndexedDB: client-side storage
- Web Workers: background computation

### Third Party APIs

- interface to interact with 3rd party service, e.g. maps, content
- needs Browser APIs to fetch data
- often constraint to security measures, e.g. API key required
