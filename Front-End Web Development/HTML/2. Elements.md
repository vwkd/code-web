## Introduction

- use semantic elements as often as possible

## Element categories

Block-level elements:
- single per line in parent element
- parent can only be other block (except anchor ???)

Inline elements:
- multiple per line in parent element
- parent can be block or inline element

--> CSS property can show them, but doesn't change element category, i.e. div can not inside span


## Structure elements

article - groups related content that is independent of rest
section - groups related part of page, single functionality
div - grouping block element for CSS, JS, non-semantic, only use if there are no suitable semantic elements
span - grouping inline element "

## Formatting elements

## Presentational elements

- don't use, use CSS instead
