## TypeScript

- statically typed superset of JS
- elevated development experience with powerful tooling around static type-checking
- zero cost since syntax is otherwise equal to JS, "compiles away" to plain JS

### Types

- turns dynamically typed language back into statically typed language
- takes JS type system and writes it down, static formalisation of JS's dynamic type system
- enforces the subset of JS that makes sense, not the one that is syntactically valid
- but much more powerful types than in any other classical language
    - implicit inference hides a lot of typing
    - types are narrowed down based on control flow, type guards, assignments, etc.
    - conditional types, everything is a type
- doesn't force you to strongly type everything, no binary choice, can dial it up gradually, the more types the better checking
- can use types to build documentation, no need to annotate just for documentation, avoids extra layer of complexity and potential errors

### Tooling

- types is what allows for powerful tooling, because values have different functionality based on their types, e.g. control flow, function arguments, available methods (a `toString()` method but not necessarily a `toUpperCase()` method), etc.
- needs to restrict values so can reason about behavior during development
- powerful tooling, e.g. error checking, statement completion, safe refactoring, code navigation etc.
- tooling during development right when needs it, not only later when trying to run it
- no more unit test for every line of code, can sleep again well at night
- knows all the stuff the programmer is otherwise supposed to know by heart
- statement completion in context, only the semantically valid, not like other IDEs any function

### Zero-cost

- removes types completely on compilation to JS
- no performance overhead since it all "compiles away", as if you had written JS in the first place, but without bugs ;)
- no extra code is injected, compiles away to plain JS
- just for error checking during development
- exact same runtime behavior and syntax, no translation, only layer on top
- type checking makes sense only during development anyways, on client during execution can not do anything, like a ship out on the sea, can not react if it breaks down
- TS doesn't prevent compilation if there is a type related error, since is still valid JS
- beware if has API that others are going to use, security is gone as soon as compiled to JS, e.g. `readonly` properties, `private` class members ⚠️

### Superset

- technically it's own language, but follows exactly ECMAScript specs, doesn't diverge from standard, just adds static types
- like JavaScript with type annotations, no overhead in translating JS implementation into TS implementation
- implements new JS features when they reach Stage 3, can use newest features
- transpiles backwards for older ES versions, but better use only for types and use Babel for transpilation


## Implicit typing

- types get inferred where ever possible, e.g. in variable assignment, return type of function, etc.
- don't need to provide types for everything, but safer so can not later accidentally change them and use them for documentation

```typescript
const age = 42;

age.toUpperCase(); // error since age is number and not string
```

- the declared type determines the types that are allowed to be assigned, even if in meantime had a more specific type

```typescript
let x = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 42 : "world";
    
x = 1;            
x = "goodbye!";
// both valid assignments since declared type was string | number
```


## Structural typing

- type compatibility is checked using duck typing ("If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck!")
- one type is compatible with another, as long as it implements _at least_ all properties of the other type

```typescript
interface Named {
  name: string;
}

function sayHi(obj: Named) {
  console.log(`Hi, my name is ${obj.name}.`);
}

const p = { name: "Peter", age: 42 };
sayHi(p); // Hi, my name is Peter.
```

```typescript
interface Named {
  name: string;
}

class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const q: Named = new Person();
```

- allows to extend existing types ???


## Control Flow Analysis

- TS narrows down types to more specific types when it can
- in if statements, switch statements, loops, conditional ternaries, etc.
- using type guards in condition, e.g. `typeof`, `instanceof`, equality operator, truthiness
