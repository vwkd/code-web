## TypeScript

- preprocessor, statically typed superset of JS that compiles to plain JS
- write JS as usual, add types
- (also works as a transpiler for older ES versions, but better use only for types and use Babel for transpilation)
- types allow for powerful error checking, e.g. control flow, function arguments, available methods, etc.
- error check layer is just during development, type declaration get deleted on compilation to JS
- security is gone as soon as compiled to JS, e.g. `readonly` properties, `private` class members ⚠️
- type checking makes sense anyways only during development, on client can not do anything
- TS doesn't prevent compilation if there is a type related error, since is still valid JS
- implements new JS features when reach Stage 3
- no performance overhead since it all "compiles away"
- static type-checking
- give variables, functions, etc. strict types, restrict values, enable more reasoning about behavior
- types are narrowed down based on control flow, type guards, assignments, etc.
- goes backwards and makes dynamically typed JS to statically typed TS, but implicit inference hides a lot of typing
- but statically typed means engine can run it faster because of optimisations
- TS has very powerful types, whole programming language around types, can combine conditionally, everything is a type
