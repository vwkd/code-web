# Classes

## Introduction

- type of class fields (≙ instance properties) are declared outside of constructor, matches syntax of classical languages

```typescript
// TypeScript
class Person {
    name: string;
    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

```javascript
// compiled JavaScript
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

- can leave out constructor if initialises with value

```typescript
// TypeScript
class Person {
    name = "Peter";
}
```

```javascript
// compiled JavaScript
class Person {
    constructor() {
        this.name = "Peter";
    }
}
```

- can limit accessibility of properties and methods by prefixing with modifiers, but only applies within TS, gets stripped away with compilation ❗️
    - `public`: property is available in- and outside class, like default JS
    - `private`: property is available only inside class, beware: even though behaves like `#` (in ES2020) within TS, doesn't compile to `#` in JS ❗️
    - `protected`: like `private`, but allows use in derived classes, needs to protect property in derived class as well if doesn't want to default to public, if protects constructor itself the class can only be extended but not instantiated
    - `readonly`: property can be written to only from within constructor, not other method or outside, but can still be read from outside

```typescript
// TypeScript
class Person {
    public name: string;
    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

```javascript
// compiled JavaScript
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

- parameter properties: instance property shorthand by prefixing constructor parameter directly with any of the modifiers

```typescript
// TypeScript
class Person {
    constructor(public name: string) {
    }
}
```

```javascript
// compiled JavaScript
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

- `static` properties can be used with same modifiers, but not use a type parameter from a generic class
- constructors themselves can not be generics or have return types
- can specify overloads for constructor
- use `strictPropertyInitialization` flag to demand initialisation of class fields to not forget
- use definite assignment assertion operator `!` after field name to assert it will be initialised, e.g. through calling some method
- a class automatically creates a type representing the classes' instances

## Inheriting classes

- use `implements` to check that a class implements a type
- can implement multiple types, separated by comma or after each other
- doesn't change class at all, just error checking, don't confuse with `extends` ❗️

```typescript
interface Named {
    name: string;
}

class Person implements Named {
    name = "Peter";
}

// Class 'Car' incorrectly implements interface 'Named'.
// Property 'name' is missing in type 'Car' but required in type 'Named'.(2420)
class Car implements Named {
    speed = 42;
}
```

## Abstract classes

- template classes
- can not be instantiated, only extended
- can contain abstract fields and methods without implementation, as well as "concrete" methods and fields with implementation
- use `abstract` keyword before `class` keyword
- abstract class is compiled to normal class, abstract fields and methods are removed
- like an interface that is implemented, but it is compiled to JS, can contain "concrete" methods as well
- like when constructor is protected, but can also contain abstract fields and methods

```typescript
abstract class Animal {
  abstract eat(): void;
}

class Lion extends Animal {
  eat() { console.log("Feeding...") }
  growl() { console.log("Grrrr...") }
}

// Non-abstract class 'Goat' does not implement inherited abstract member 'eat' from class 'Animal'.(2515)
class Goat extends Animal {
  maeh() { console.log("Maehhh...") }
}

const x = new Animal(); // Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.
const y = new Lion();
```
