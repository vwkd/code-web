## Classes

<!-- ToDo: Finish -->
implements? - can be implemented by class using `implements` keyword

- properties need to be declared outside of constructor to be able to give types

```typescript
// TypeScript
class Person {
    name: string;
    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

// compiled JS
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

- can prefix properties with modifiers to limit accessibility, but only apply within TS, get stripped away with compilation ❗️
- `public` is available in- and outside class, like default JS
- `private` is available only inside class, beware: even though like `#` in ES2020, doesn't compile to `#`❗️
- `protected` is like `private`, but allows use in derived classes, if protects constructor the class can only be extended but not instantiated
- `readonly` allows to write from within class only, but can still read from outside

```typescript
// TypeScript
class Person {
    public name: string;
    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

// compiled JS
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

- property setting shorthand by prefixing constructor parameter directly with any of the modifiers
```typescript
// TypeScript
class Person {
    constructor(public name: string) {
    }
}

// compiled JS
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

- `abstract` classes are template classes, can not be instantiated, only extended, derived classes can not create new methods not defined in abstract class
- a class automatically creates a type representing the classes' instances, can be used like an interface
