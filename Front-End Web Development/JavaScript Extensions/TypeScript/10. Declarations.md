## Declaration file

<!-- ToDo: Finish -->
- declaration files contain only type information
- named `*.d.ts`
- TS includes declaration files for built-in APIs in JS runtimes, e.g. DOM, BOM, Events, etc. pp.
- without type information would need to know everything by heart or look it up
- with type information the IDE can describe and error check input
