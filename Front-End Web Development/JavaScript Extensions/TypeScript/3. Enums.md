## Enums

<!-- ToDo: Finish -->
- fixed length set of named constants
- constants have distinct values so can be compared and assigned, by default ascending integers
- used to limit selection to fixed set, set of distinct cases, e.g. boolean type is an enum, can only select between `true` and `false`
- use like properties of object
- implemented as object that has two opposite key-value pairs for each constant, namely name-value and value-name
- can specify values to be integers, strings or a computation of that ???
- can make enums `const`, allow only constant enum expressions ???, are removed completely on compile time

```javascript
enum Direction {
  Up, Right, Down, Left,
}

const mydir: Direction = Direction.Up;
```
