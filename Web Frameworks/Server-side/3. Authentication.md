## Introduction

- ???



## API keys

- never hardcode into source code, instead use environment variables
- can set environment variables
  - remotely: save in UI, e.g. GitHub, Netlify, etc.
  - locally (single use): provide as command-line arguments
  - locally (multiple use): create `.env` file that's excluded from VCS with keys, write script that loads content and sets environment variables, e.g. `dotenv` module
- beware: always document required environment variables, e.g. create `sample.env` that's not excluded from VCS with sample keys ❗️
<!-- How to limit access to proxy server to only come from instances of the web page ?? CAN'T, just within browser can limit using CORS but no guarantees from manual clients like curl ?? -->
- beware: on client has no environment variables, needs to use proxy server that proxies request and adds key ❗️
