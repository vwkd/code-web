## Static site generator

COMPILER !!!

compiler of dynamically written website to static website
allows to write dynamical website but compile to statical website
write dynamically and publish statically
gives best of both worlds, as long as doesn't need personalisation ?!?!
"render" content into HTML files, although "render" should be "populate"
at build time

allow template files
"rendering" here is just "assembling", not rendering visually, just populating file
-> server-side rendering

may also allow to populate with content from database
beware: is only at build time, not dynamic webite !!!
