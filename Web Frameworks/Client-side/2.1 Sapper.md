# Sapper

[TOC]


<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction

creates static, client-side rendered, client-side routed website with initial page server-side rendered

?? framework
<!-- todo: update "framework" to correct term in 8. Website architecture -->

- static site generator for server-side rendered ??

- server-side rendering for initial page, and client-side rendering for subsequent pages
server-side "rendering", (as opposed to pure Svelte client-side "rendering") ??? IMPLIED ALREADY SINCE SSG ?!?!
hydrates static HTML on client
server-rendered views with client-side hydration 

--> developer tool instead of framework


Express-compatible middleware

beware: not a Web application framework that runs a Web server like Koa !!!

## Features

- svelte compiler ??
- template syntax ???
- client-side routing with preloading ??? hover or keydown instead of keyup on link ???

??? can export a static site, creates the .json files for the client-site rendered routes
??? only export when each page is identical for any two distinct requests

 When a user first visits the application, they will be served a server-rendered version of the route in question, plus some JavaScript that 'hydrates' the page and initialises a client-side router. From that point forward, navigating to other pages is handled entirely on the client for a fast, app-like feel.

 currently can only run either express middleware that ??? SERVES THE ??? or output static files, not both depending on route
 currently server-side rendered markup is replaced by client-side rendered one as soon as runtime loads ??? SOURCE YT VIDEO FROM RICH
    I.E. hydration is done badly

- code-splitting for each route
- offline support ??
SEO optimisations ???

## Routing

filesystem-based
each Svelte component is a route
in `src/routes`

can create server routes as well ??
JSON API
needs to use Sapper as middleware ???


TODO: SSG incremental build of only that pages that changed
