# Sapper

[TOC]


<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction

- static site generator for client-side routed Svelte applications
beware: also allows server-side rendering of dynamic website as Express middleware
??? client-side routing via HTTP API only if Sapper is middleware ??

<!-- todo: update "framework" to correct term in 8. Website architecture -->


## Features

- contains Svelte compiler
- HTML template syntax ???

????
- markdown templates
- basic data flow, e.g. variables in frontmatter
- configurable routes
- set of pages, e.g. navigation, tags, etc.
- processing plugins, e.g. `<code>` syntax highlighting, etc.
- incremental build of only pages that changed
????

?? accessibility, e.g. history, focus on top of page, etc.

??? can export a static site, creates the .json files for the client-site rendered routes
??? but must make sure before exporting that each page is identical for any two distinct requests


currently server-side rendered markup is replaced by client-side rendered one as soon as runtime loads ??? SOURCE YT VIDEO FROM RICH
    I.E. hydration is done badly


## Routing

- filesystem-based
- each Svelte component in `src/routes` is a route

can exclude files by using leading underscore in file name

if has folder named `blog`, needs to put at `index.svelte` inside instead of outside as `blog.svelte` ???

slugs are ???
`[slug].svelte`
also preload method gets an argument with a `params` property that contains the slug name ?? in the slug property
i.e. `preload({ params }) { ... params.slug ... }`

beware: in slug compiler doesn't know what elements appear, eliminates unused CSS, needs to workaround using wrapper object and `:global(..)` modifier
```css
.wrapper :global(myselector) {

}
```

## Prefetching

enable with non-standard `rel=prefetch` attribute on a element ?? or hyperlink ??
?? how does it work

in component where link is pointing to, in a separate `module` script tag, export a `preload` function that fetches and returns data
uses `this.fetch()` ?? WHY
uses `this.error` in case of error
must return an object with a key that is named like the data, e.g. `{ post: ... }` ???

### Server routes

As well as pages (Svelte components, which render on server or client), you can create server routes in your routes directory.

These are just .js files that export functions corresponding to HTTP methods, and receive Express request and response objects as arguments.
This makes it very easy to, for example, add a JSON API such as the one powering this very page

needs to use Sapper as middleware ???


## QUESTIONS

- why use root as base for relative urls?
