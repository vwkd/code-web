# Svelte

[TOC]

<!-- ToDo: finish -->


## Introduction

- client-side component framework
- compiler instead of runtime
--> developer tool instead of framework

client-side rendered, server-side routing
- no client-side routing, since not a runtime, instead see Sapper

compiler gives warnings, e.g. unused styles, accessibility, etc.


## Component

- `.svelte` file
- superset of HTML, not JavaScript like other frameworks
- template syntax
- 


## Template Syntax

JavaScript template language in curly braces

control blocks are prefixed in start block by `#` and in end block by `/`, e.g. `#if` and `/if` or `#each` and `/each`, etc.

```html
{#if expression}...{/if}

{#if expression}...{:else if expression}...{/if}

{#if expression}...{:else}...{/if}
```

```html
{#each expression as name}...{/each}

{#each expression as name, index}...{/each}

{#each expression as name (key)}...{/each}

{#each expression as name, index (key)}...{/each}

{#each expression as name}...{:else}...{/each}
```

```html
{#await expression}...{:then name}...{:catch name}...{/await}

{#await expression}...{:then name}...{/await}

{#await expression then name}...{/await}
```

- `{expression}` text expressions, any JS expression, can be used anywhere, including in attribute names and values
by default escaped, `{@html expression}` for unescaped HTML



- variables can be defined in script tag, 
HTML is "reactively" updated whenever value of JS variable changes due to assignment
beware: only works if value of variable changes due to assignment, including if assigns to property of object / array, but not by function call, e.g. `.push()` method of array, etc., need to use destructuring assignment instead ❗️
better anyways to not mutate object through method, but assign variable to new copy of it

- can use for attributes value without quotes, included if not nullish, for boolean attributes included if truthy

```html
<style>
let foo = "green"
  
let bar = false;
</style>

<input id={bar} checked={bar}/>
```

for name={name} can shorten to {name}

```html
<style>
let id = "green"
  
let checked = false;
</style>

<input {id} {checked}/>
```

or can use spread operator to set multiple attributes at once

```html
<style>
let checkbox = {
  type: "checkbox",
  class: "green",
  checked: false
}
</style>

<input {...checkbox}/>
```


### Element directive

- event handlers, multiple for same event possible
by default events don't "bubble" to parent component, on:eventname (without handler) forwards event to parent component
valid modifiers: preventDefault, stopPropagation, capture, once, passive, self

```html
on:eventname={handler}

on:eventname|modifiers={handler}
```

can bind some element attributes to variable, e.g. `value`, `checked` of `<input>` element
like event handler that updates variable, and variable updates value, two-way
some are read-only to variable, some are two-way

```html
bind:property={variable}
```

If variable name matches the attribute name, can use shorthand `bind:property`
values are usually strings, except:
values of `<input type="number" bind:value={num}>` and `<input type="range" bind:value={num}>` are coerced to numbers
value of `<input type="file" bind:files={filelist}/>` are FileList object



## Component

components can be nested, imported in script tag, used like HTML element
a lowercase tag is a HTML tag, uppercase tag is a component

prop: attribute on a component, set by consuming component like HTML attributes, declared in script tag of component by `export` keyword
beware: only variable declarations are editable component properties, function declaration, class, etc. are read-only properties of component, can't be set ❗️

can listen for events same way as on element, needs to dispatch in nested component using CreateEventDispatcher.dispatch(CustomEvent)
events don't "bubble" between components, needs to forwards using on:event without handler


## JavaScript

- one script tag per component, runs when component is instantiated


- prefix JS statements with `$` label to "reactively" rerun when value of variables they depend on change
beware: same as with HTML reactivity, only works if value of variable changes due to assignment, e.g. not if variable is array and uses `.push()` method, can instead use destructuring assignment ❗️
statements rerun in topological order

for single variable declaration can leave out prefix `let`

## CSS

- one style tag per component, scoped to component with random "svelte-XXXXXX" class
based on a hash of the component styles
can escape with non-standard `:global(myselector)` modifier
  `:global()` can appear in chain, then only goes as global as previous selector ??!!??
- CSS style tags are scoped to component, doesn't need to handle global CSS anymore

can reactively update CSS styles by declaring Custom Variable in inline style

```html
<script>
  let cols = 4;
</script>

<style>
  ul {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(var(--columns), 1fr);
  }
</style>

<ul style="--columns:{cols}">...</ul>
```

unused styles are removed on compilation


#### Stores

info shared between components??
synchronises state across your component hierarchy

motion package is built from stores




<!-- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -->

<!-- ToDo: Difference reactive programming and reactive frameworks -->

## Reactive Frameworks

- don't confuse with reactive programming, bad naming choice
reactive frameworks : forward references

- not what should happen at each moment, but what result should be, how app should look like, e.g. `Hello ${name}.` where `name` is automatically updated as soon as it changes
  declarative instead of imperative

- specifies the dynamic behavior of a value completely at the time of declaration
no need to go update value when something changes
when a value changes the app should "react"



- needs way to assign variable that doesn't copy values but only link, like mathematical variables or spreadsheet cells

```javascript
// pseudocode
a = 1;
b = a * 2;
a = 21;
/* b should now be 42 */
```

- could be implemented as function which recomputes dependent value only if independent value changed

```javascript
let a = 1;

const b = (function () {
    let oldA = a;
    let cache;

    return function () {
        if (oldA === a && cache !== undefined) {
            return cache;
        } else {
            cache = a * 2;
            oldA = a;
            return cache;
        }
    };
}());

a = 21;
b(); // 42
```

- needs code that continuously "reacts" based on different outside conditions, e.g. the independent variable is the mouse coordinates and all dependent variables are computed from it as soon as it changes


- reactive JS frameworks make HTML reactive
- can use JS variables in HTML, update DOM as soon as the value in JS updates
- without needed to manually hop out to JS, attach event handler, select DOM element, update it
- frameworks abstracts away the manual JS code, write HTML as if it had reactive variables
- but at end of day is just the same JS, variables can only live in JS
- just developing experience is more integrated, dynamisism not on top of HTML but inside it
- "keep DOM in sync with your application state", means update DOM elements using the values of the variables in the components
- beware: can use reaction to change DOM because every DOM node is independent, but can't use reaction to change parts of JS code, since code is interdependent on other code is not possible to change out a bit without affecting rest, e.g. what would happen to other lines using `b`, would need to reexecute them, but then needs to reexecute the lines that depend on those lines as well, but in what order, nondeterministic issue, also can't just execute whole file again since would just get in same problem


## Introduction

- compiles to HTML, CSS and JS, only needs to bundle minimal framework, there is no framework, do all the complexity in build process, don't ship to user
- frameworks that runs in the build process instead of in the browser of the client
turns declarative component code into imperative vanilla JS code on the right

- uses labeled statements to make linked variables ?? like spreadsheet cells

- `.svelte` components combine HTML, JS, and CSS
- components get compiled to JS classes, can be imported and instantiated
- scripts and styles are scoped by default to component, no need to use deep class structures or naming schemes anymore, ???? to target elements from within JS or CSS

- uses CSS animations instead of in JavaScript

- top-level is HTML, styles and scripts go inside their tags, most natural choice since Web is written in HTML  
  unlike in other frameworks where writes HTML and CSS in strings inside JavaScript

- also has template-like functionality for HTML, e.g. if statements, for loops

- can use JS expressions inside `{}` in HTML, like template literals in JS without `$`

- use `export` keyword in script tag ????

```html
<script>
  const name = "Peter"
</script>

<p>Hi, I am {name}.</p>
```

- DOM is automatically updated as soon as JS expressions change, e.g. using event handler

```html
<script>
	let count = 0;
</script>

<p>You clicked the button {count} {count === 1 ? 'time' : 'times'}.</p>

<button on:click={() => {count += 1}}>Submit</button>
```

- reactivity is implemented using labeled statement `$` in JS, executed if value of referenced variables changes
- reactive declarations update affected DOM nodes as soon as value changes

```html
<script>
  let x = 0;
  $: y = x * 2;
</script>

<p>You did not click the button {y} times.</p>

<button on:click={() => {x += 1}}>Submit</button>
```

- reactive statements get executed as soon as referenced values change

```html
<script>
  let x = 0;

  $: {
  console.log(`The current value is ${x}.`);
  }
</script>

<p>You clicked the button {x} times.</p>

<button on:click={() => {x += 1}}>Submit</button>
```

- since reactivity is triggered by assignments, mutating objects won't trigger an update, e.g. e.g. `obj.foo = 42`, `arr.push(42)`, `arr[0] = 42`, etc., need to do a useless self assign afterwards to trigger, e.g. `obj = obj`
- beware: doesn't make sense to use reactive declarations in JS itself, see [Reactive Programming](#) ❗️



## Summary

- use small enough components that bundling HTML, JS and CSS in one file makes sense again



## Open questions

### Markup

- what are components compiled to
- what about the `index.html`, what is in it if all is in `.svelte`?

### Styles

- what about SASS features
- global variables, e.g. primary color
- how do you layout components

### Scripts



## Ideas

- why don't implement reactive operator in JS for reactive declaration, e.g. `y :: x * 2`;
- why don't put HTML, JS, and CSS all top level? no separate `style` or `script` tags
