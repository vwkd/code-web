# Svelte

[TOC]

<!-- ToDo: finish -->


# Template language

Any JS in curly braces in HTML
(not CSS because not component-scoped??)

??Data flow logic use #, see later
Logic blocks using `#`, e.g. if, each
can reference value in each block like usual JS variable, e.g. bind to it

directives are custom HTML attributes?

Can contain only a single script and style tag
Except another script ?? module
Styles are automatically scoped



## Components

Can import component like ES module, then use it like HTML tag
Empty tag if doesn’t have slot
Tag with HTML content if has slot, essentially has children
Convention: lowercase html tags, uppercase component names

Content in slot itself is fallback

Can use multiple slots, give them a name attribute
In content in parent element can then use slot=<NAME> attribute on different elements to send them into different slots

Slots can have attributes, can access in parent component where places content in it using ‘let:attr’, is local to component
If named slots, needs to specify let on element where also specifies slot=“..”

get passed UP to parent component, 
Counter intuitive since uses property instead of export



## Reactivity

“Reactive”, built in, updates relevant part of DOM when JS variable is reassigned, e.g. due to event
BEWARE: ONLY TOP-LEVEL VARIABLE, VARIABLES IN BLOCKS ARE LOCAL TO SCRIPT
Doesn’t yet change any functionality of JS
Beware: can’t use mutating methods, e.g. on array push(), pop(), shift, splice, on object mutating methods, etc., needs to either reassign `a=a` or use spread operator,
Rule of thumb: “Reactive variable” must be on left side of assignment operator

If needs specific JS to rerun, needs to label statement with `$`
if block, reruns whole block, beware: variable declarations aren’t visible outside
If variable declaration, leave out `let`, is implicit `let` otherwise wouldn’t be able to update

Event handlers inline using `on:eventname` modifiers using `|` after name
Beware: event is seen only within the component ?!?! NO, DO BUBBLE!!
shorthand on:click registers handler with same name click ?!

Bindings on certain attributes bind JS variable to value of attribute two-way ?!
just sugar for also adding event handlers that sets JS variable
Bindings: value of <input>/<textarea>/<select>, checked on checkbox <input>, group of checkbox/radio <input>... ???
Elements with a contenteditable="true" attribute support textContent and innerHTML bindings
<video>/<audio> have several bindings
Every block-level element has READONLY clientWidth, clientHeight, offsetWidth and offsetHeight bindings ??? In HTML5 there are no block level elements, depends on layout
readonly “this” binding for every element (and component), beware will be undefined until component has mounted, use onMount lifecycle function to wait for that
Readonly innerWidth, innerHeight, outerWidth, outerHeight, online on <svelte:window>
Two way scrollX, scrollY on <svelte:window>
Mouseenter, mouseleave on <svelte:body>

Can be read only binding, i.e. like pure event listener that sets variable, or two way binding
Shorthand bind:value binds to variable with same name value ?!



## Props

Component properties, “props”
Using export keyword
Are reactive

Events between components using createEventDispatcher, event handler on component like on HTML tag
Can forward if doesn’t specify handler function
Beware: unlike DOM events, don’t automatically bubble through component hierarchy, i.e. not visible on ancestor that’s not parent
Can also forward DOM events to another component to specify handler
Can also bind to component properties like HTML attributes

Pass non-reactive values between ancestor and descendant component using setContext, getContext instead of props
setContext stores data globally under a key, can then access using getContext and same key in any descendant component
Are just better way than passing context as component property, esp. if has long component chain and only needs property in very nested component but not in between
???in child component, same for every one, not dependent if parent components sets it on each individual child component???
Like a forced component property that parent doesn’t need to specify explicitly
beware: not reactive, but can pass a store as value, then is reactive
BUT THEN CAN JUST DIRECTLY IMPORT STORE, ALSO ALLOWS TO USE STORE ANYWHERE NOT ONLY IN DESCENDANT COMPONENT
GetContext gets value from CLOSEST ancestor component that sets it, i.e. can overshadow it, like property inheritance in JS objects
Beware: must be called synchronously during initialization



## Lifecycle
Components have a lifecycle
When put into DOM, when DOM is updated due to reactive values (in component), removed from DOM
e.g. as child of another component that renders it conditionally in if block is mounted/destroyed depending on condition

can run functions at different points in lifecycle
Must be called synchronously during initialization, except tick
Don’t run on SSR except onDestroy
e.g. use to load data only when on client,
scrolling, etc.

onMount: when first rendered to DOM, can return a function that is shorthand for onDestroy ?!?
onDestroy: when removed from DOM
beforeUpdate, afterUpdate: when reactively updated in DOM
tick: returns a promise that resolves as soon as any pending state changes have been applied to the DOM (or immediately, if there are no pending state changes). Just to use as timer to await, Like timeout(..,0) but before DOM repaint
I.E. LIKE notification when afterUpdate() runs? OR IN BETWEEN beforeUpdate and afterUpdate?



## Stores

Data container
object with internal state, and subscribe method that calls argument when value changes
??? Like rxJS
Readable store has no more methods
Writable store has also set, update methods

Use when needs to read/write value across multiple components

Initialization take initial value, start function (called when first subscriber, set argument to set store, e.g. use to create interval to update data regularly), returns stop function (called after last unsubscribed, e.g. use to stop interval)
?? Like onMount / onDestroy for store instead of component

Subscribe returns unsubscribe method, needs to call when component is destroyed otherwise dangling reference -> memory leak

Shorthand $name for wiring up subscription to $name variable and unsubscription to onDestroy automatically 
Beware: can use $ as first letter only when using stores

Can create custom stores by object that has subscribe method

Can create derived store from existing store
Derived takes old store and function that takes value and returns new value derived from that

For writable store, can modify it using binding or assignment operators, shorthands for calling its set method using the value
$name += “world” is name.set($name += “world”)

Motion stores, stores whose values change over time after set and update, rather than immediately
Set and update return promise when transition completes
can give duration, delay, easing functions
E.g. progress bar, cursor



## Transitions 

implemented in CSS, reversible, efficient
directives: in, out, or transition for both
beware for different in out transitions are not reversible
Can give argument after equal sign e.g. In:fly=“value”

Can also create custom CSS, or JS transitions
Beware: prefer CSS over JS because more efficient and doesn’t block main thread

introstart, introend, outrostart, outroend events

Modifier local to only play transition when element itself is added/removed, not if any ancestor is added/removed

TODO: ADD LOCAL TO TODO-MVC

Crossfade transition creates pair of transitions that are opposite, used for making element appear to move instead of disappear and reappear,
Argument of handler is object with key property



## Animations

??
Can give argument after equal sign



## Actions

??
?? element-level lifecycle functions
use using use directive
Can give argument after equal sign

Can emit custom events that can be listened to

Function returns object with destroy() method
Can also have update() method, called when argument of action changes, I.e. needs to give action an argument for update() to make sense



## Class attribute

Shorthand class:foo={expression}, adds class “foo” when expression is truthy, removes if falsy
Just sugar for class={expression ? “foo” : “”}
Shorthand class:foo if expression is only single variable with same name “foo”



## Special components

<svelte:self> refers to component itself, e.g. recursive components
<svelte:component this=COMP_NAME>: dynamically computed component name
<svelte:window> for window, can use with declarative event handlers, bindings, otherwise would need to hook up manually through JS object
<svelte:body> for body, same reason as window
<svelte:head> for head, can use to load link elements conditionally
Beware: head is different in SSR ???
<svelte:options> for component options, e.g. immutable



## Module script

Executed the single time when evaluates that component
Not when instantiated, no matter how often a single component instance is created/destroyed, or how many different are created/destroyed
(Normal script is run when component is instantiated, i.e. mounted ???)

Can use to keep state across multiple instances of same component
E.g. keep only single one active

Can export stuff, is “real” export from module like in JS
Beware: can’t declare default export, since component itself is already default export



## ???

Style, script blocks in lower than top levels? E.g. in if block, await block, etc.

https://easings.net/en#



------- OLD --------

## Introduction

- client-side component framework
- compiler instead of runtime
--> developer tool instead of framework

client-side rendered, server-side routing
- no client-side routing, since not a runtime, instead see Sapper

compiler gives warnings, e.g. unused styles, accessibility, etc.


## Component

- `.svelte` file
- superset of HTML, not JavaScript like other frameworks
- template syntax
- 


## Template Syntax

JavaScript template language in curly braces

control blocks are prefixed in start block by `#` and in end block by `/`, e.g. `#if` and `/if` or `#each` and `/each`, etc.

```html
{#if expression}...{/if}

{#if expression}...{:else if expression}...{/if}

{#if expression}...{:else}...{/if}
```

```html
{#each expression as name}...{/each}

{#each expression as name, index}...{/each}

{#each expression as name (key)}...{/each}

{#each expression as name, index (key)}...{/each}

{#each expression as name}...{:else}...{/each}
```

```html
{#await expression}...{:then name}...{:catch name}...{/await}

{#await expression}...{:then name}...{/await}

{#await expression then name}...{/await}
```

- `{expression}` text expressions, any JS expression, can be used anywhere, including in attribute names and values
by default escaped, `{@html expression}` for unescaped HTML



- variables can be defined in script tag, 
HTML is "reactively" updated whenever value of JS variable changes due to assignment
beware: only works if value of variable changes due to assignment, including if assigns to property of object / array, but not by function call, e.g. `.push()` method of array, etc., need to use destructuring assignment instead ❗️
better anyways to not mutate object through method, but assign variable to new copy of it

- can use for attributes value without quotes, included if not nullish, for boolean attributes included if truthy

```html
<style>
let foo = "green"
  
let bar = false;
</style>

<input id={bar} checked={bar}/>
```

for name={name} can shorten to {name}

```html
<style>
let id = "green"
  
let checked = false;
</style>

<input {id} {checked}/>
```

or can use spread operator to set multiple attributes at once

```html
<style>
let checkbox = {
  type: "checkbox",
  class: "green",
  checked: false
}
</style>

<input {...checkbox}/>
```


### Element directive

- event handlers, multiple for same event possible
by default events don't "bubble" to parent component, on:eventname (without handler) forwards event to parent component
valid modifiers: preventDefault, stopPropagation, capture, once, passive, self

```html
on:eventname={handler}

on:eventname|modifiers={handler}
```

can bind some element attributes to variable, e.g. `value`, `checked` of `<input>` element
like event handler that updates variable, and variable updates value, two-way
some are read-only to variable, some are two-way

```html
bind:property={variable}
```

If variable name matches the attribute name, can use shorthand `bind:property`
values are usually strings, except:
values of `<input type="number" bind:value={num}>` and `<input type="range" bind:value={num}>` are coerced to numbers
value of `<input type="file" bind:files={filelist}/>` are FileList object



## Component

components can be nested, imported in script tag, used like HTML element
a lowercase tag is a HTML tag, uppercase tag is a component

prop: attribute on a component, set by consuming component like HTML attributes, declared in script tag of component by `export` keyword
beware: only variable declarations are editable component properties, function declaration, class, etc. are read-only properties of component, can't be set ❗️

can listen for events same way as on element, needs to dispatch in nested component using CreateEventDispatcher.dispatch(CustomEvent)
events don't "bubble" between components, needs to forwards using on:event without handler


## JavaScript

- one script tag per component, runs when component is instantiated


- prefix JS statements with `$` label to "reactively" rerun when value of variables they depend on change
beware: same as with HTML reactivity, only works if value of variable changes due to assignment, e.g. not if variable is array and uses `.push()` method, can instead use destructuring assignment ❗️
statements rerun in topological order

for single variable declaration can leave out prefix `let`

## CSS

- one style tag per component, scoped to component with random "svelte-XXXXXX" class
based on a hash of the component styles
can escape with non-standard `:global(myselector)` modifier
  `:global()` can appear in chain, then only goes as global as previous selector ??!!??
- CSS style tags are scoped to component, doesn't need to handle global CSS anymore

can reactively update CSS styles by declaring Custom Variable in inline style

```html
<script>
  let cols = 4;
</script>

<style>
  ul {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(var(--columns), 1fr);
  }
</style>

<ul style="--columns:{cols}">...</ul>
```

unused styles are removed on compilation


#### Stores

info shared between components??
synchronises state across your component hierarchy

motion package is built from stores




<!-- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -->

<!-- ToDo: Difference reactive programming and reactive frameworks -->

## Reactive Frameworks

- don't confuse with reactive programming, bad naming choice
reactive frameworks : forward references

- not what should happen at each moment, but what result should be, how app should look like, e.g. `Hello ${name}.` where `name` is automatically updated as soon as it changes
  declarative instead of imperative

- specifies the dynamic behavior of a value completely at the time of declaration
no need to go update value when something changes
when a value changes the app should "react"



- needs way to assign variable that doesn't copy values but only link, like mathematical variables or spreadsheet cells

```javascript
// pseudocode
a = 1;
b = a * 2;
a = 21;
/* b should now be 42 */
```

- could be implemented as function which recomputes dependent value only if independent value changed

```javascript
let a = 1;

const b = (function () {
    let oldA = a;
    let cache;

    return function () {
        if (oldA === a && cache !== undefined) {
            return cache;
        } else {
            cache = a * 2;
            oldA = a;
            return cache;
        }
    };
}());

a = 21;
b(); // 42
```

- needs code that continuously "reacts" based on different outside conditions, e.g. the independent variable is the mouse coordinates and all dependent variables are computed from it as soon as it changes


- reactive JS frameworks make HTML reactive
- can use JS variables in HTML, update DOM as soon as the value in JS updates
- without needed to manually hop out to JS, attach event handler, select DOM element, update it
- frameworks abstracts away the manual JS code, write HTML as if it had reactive variables
- but at end of day is just the same JS, variables can only live in JS
- just developing experience is more integrated, dynamisism not on top of HTML but inside it
- "keep DOM in sync with your application state", means update DOM elements using the values of the variables in the components
- beware: can use reaction to change DOM because every DOM node is independent, but can't use reaction to change parts of JS code, since code is interdependent on other code is not possible to change out a bit without affecting rest, e.g. what would happen to other lines using `b`, would need to reexecute them, but then needs to reexecute the lines that depend on those lines as well, but in what order, nondeterministic issue, also can't just execute whole file again since would just get in same problem


## Introduction

- compiles to HTML, CSS and JS, only needs to bundle minimal framework, there is no framework, do all the complexity in build process, don't ship to user
- frameworks that runs in the build process instead of in the browser of the client
turns declarative component code into imperative vanilla JS code on the right

- uses labeled statements to make linked variables ?? like spreadsheet cells

- `.svelte` components combine HTML, JS, and CSS
- components get compiled to JS classes, can be imported and instantiated
- scripts and styles are scoped by default to component, no need to use deep class structures or naming schemes anymore, ???? to target elements from within JS or CSS

- uses CSS animations instead of in JavaScript

- top-level is HTML, styles and scripts go inside their tags, most natural choice since Web is written in HTML  
  unlike in other frameworks where writes HTML and CSS in strings inside JavaScript

- also has template-like functionality for HTML, e.g. if statements, for loops

- can use JS expressions inside `{}` in HTML, like template literals in JS without `$`

- use `export` keyword in script tag ????

```html
<script>
  const name = "Peter"
</script>

<p>Hi, I am {name}.</p>
```

- DOM is automatically updated as soon as JS expressions change, e.g. using event handler

```html
<script>
	let count = 0;
</script>

<p>You clicked the button {count} {count === 1 ? 'time' : 'times'}.</p>

<button on:click={() => {count += 1}}>Submit</button>
```

- reactivity is implemented using labeled statement `$` in JS, executed if value of referenced variables changes
- reactive declarations update affected DOM nodes as soon as value changes

```html
<script>
  let x = 0;
  $: y = x * 2;
</script>

<p>You did not click the button {y} times.</p>

<button on:click={() => {x += 1}}>Submit</button>
```

- reactive statements get executed as soon as referenced values change

```html
<script>
  let x = 0;

  $: {
  console.log(`The current value is ${x}.`);
  }
</script>

<p>You clicked the button {x} times.</p>

<button on:click={() => {x += 1}}>Submit</button>
```

- since reactivity is triggered by assignments, mutating objects won't trigger an update, e.g. e.g. `obj.foo = 42`, `arr.push(42)`, `arr[0] = 42`, etc., need to do a useless self assign afterwards to trigger, e.g. `obj = obj`
- beware: doesn't make sense to use reactive declarations in JS itself, see [Reactive Programming](#) ❗️



## Summary

- use small enough components that bundling HTML, JS and CSS in one file makes sense again



## Open questions

### Markup

- what are components compiled to
- what about the `index.html`, what is in it if all is in `.svelte`?

### Styles

- what about SASS features
- global variables, e.g. primary color
- how do you layout components

### Scripts



## Ideas

- why don't implement reactive operator in JS for reactive declaration, e.g. `y :: x * 2`;
- why don't put HTML, JS, and CSS all top level? no separate `style` or `script` tags




## Installation

- install svelte
- install prettier plugin
- install eslint plugin
- install Svelte for VS Code plugin

- Syntax highlighting for VS Code

```json
{
  "files.associations": {
    "*.svelte": "html"
  }
}
```
