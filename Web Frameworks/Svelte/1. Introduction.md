# Svelte



## Introduction

- client-side web framework
- work happens at compile step instead of at runtime, no virtual DOM
- more declarative syntax since compiler can do magic, less lines of code, less bugs
- lower bundle size since compiler includes only what actually needs, faster loading
- many optional niceities, e.g. transitions, accessibility warnings, etc.
