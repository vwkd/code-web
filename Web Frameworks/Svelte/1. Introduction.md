# Svelte



## Introduction

- client-side web framework
- work happens at compile step instead of at runtime, no virtual DOM
- cleaner more declarative syntax, since compiler can do magic
- lower bundle size, since compiler includes only what actually needs
- many optional niceities, e.g. transitions, accessibility warnings, etc.
- no built-in router for client-side routing, i.e. website uses server-side routing
- see SvelteKit for server-side rendering and client-side routing
