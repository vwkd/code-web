# Svelte



## Introduction

- client-side web framework for web page
- work happens at compile step instead of at runtime, no virtual DOM
- more declarative syntax, since compiled
- offers many niceities like transitions, compiles only to code that actually needs
- less code, faster loading ðŸŽ‰
- by default compiles to JavaScript, i.e. website is client-side rendered
- no built-in router for client-side routing, i.e. website uses server-side routing
- see SvelteKit for server-side rendering and client-side routing
