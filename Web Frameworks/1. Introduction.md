# Web frameworks

[TOC]


<!-- ToDo: finish -->

## Introduction

- frameworks for website and HTTP Server
- more declarative
- beware: many names for same thing, e.g. for client-side "front-end frameworks", "MV* frameworks", for server-side "back-end frameworks", "application frameworks", etc. ❗️



## Client-side

- for website
- abstracts away underlying HTML, CSS and JavaScript, e.g. DOM API
- reusable components that combine structure, style and behavior instead of separating them
- declarative updating of view when data changes, "reactive"
- e.g. Svelte, React, etc.



## Server-side

- for HTTP server
- abstracts away underlying HTTP server, e.g. `http` module in Node
- e.g. Koa, Express, etc.
- exposes an API to declaratively handle requests and responses
