# API keys

<!-- todo: finish 
? should be own section or not ? -->



## Introduction

- non-standardised direct access for M2M



credentials is single key without username

often used if RS doesn't offer U2M, just M2M
simpler

can use on public client if RS just wants to count stats, needs to accept that stats aren't perfectly valid
or if RS still limits API key, RS can deactivate API key when over-used, developer needs to generate new one, better than completely open API

beware: don't send API key in URL, can leak, see Session

can think of as permanent session identifier
  except issued beforehand, not at runtime


M2M credentials
<!-- todo: move somewhere better place -->
- never hardcode into source code, instead use environment variables
- can set environment variables
  - remotely: save in UI, e.g. GitHub, Netlify, etc.
  - locally (single use): provide as command-line arguments
  - locally (multiple use): create `.env` file that's excluded from VCS with keys, write script that loads content and sets environment variables, e.g. `dotenv` module
- beware: always document required environment variables, e.g. create `sample.env` that's not excluded from VCS with sample keys ❗️
- beware: on public client has no environment variables, needs to use proxy server that does request on its behalf, e.g. FaaS ❗️



<!-- 

- beware: don't implement OAuth as part of API itself, makes API target of attack, use separate auth server, e.g. stricter rate limit, etc.
