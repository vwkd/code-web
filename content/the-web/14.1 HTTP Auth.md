# HTTP auth



## Introduction

- standard for direct access
- beware: bad naming choices containing "authorization" and "authentication", e.g. header names, status codes, etc. ❗️
- beware: don't use anymore, instead use OAuth ❗️



## Access flow

- server challenges client to provide authentication in `WWW-Authenticate: <type> realm=<realm>` response header
- client sends credentials in `Authorization: <type> <credentials>` request header of each request
- if proxy server, instead has `Proxy-Authenticate` response header and `Proxy-Authorization` request header

- `401 Unauthorized` status code if authenticated incorrectly
- if proxy server, instead has `407 Proxy Authentication Required` status code
- `403 Forbidden` status code if authenticated correctly but not authorized

### Type `Basic`

- credentials is encoding of `<username>:<password>`, e.g. base64
- username and password may not contain colons, otherwise not clear what's username and password on server after decoding
- beware: credentials are neither encrypted nor authenticated, only ever use over HTTPS ⚠️

### Type `Digest`

- credentials is hash of `<username>:<password>`, e.g. SHA256, MD5, etc.
- uses nonce to give originality, otherwise attacker can just replay hash
- beware: over HTTPS has no benefit over `Basic`, more expensive and more roundtrips ❗️



## Clients

### UA

- UA automatically gives popup for user name and password
- UA usually caches credentials and authenticates and uses silently on subsequent requests
- website has no way to control credential caching in UA, e.g. for which domains or paths, duration of cache, etc.
- beware: credential caching is convenience feature individual to a UA, not mandated or regulated by any spec ⚠️
- previously UAs allowed to specify credentials alternatively in `userinfo` field of URL besides popup field, didn't need to wait for challenge from server, but deprecated due to phishing URLs, e.g. `http://google.com:search@evil.com`
- advantages:
  - simple, because no login page, built-in UA popup
- disadvantages:
  - simple, because no login page, built-in UA popup, e.g. appearance, descriptions, multiple steps / factors, etc.

### Others

- beware: for U2M, non-browser-based client sees credentials, e.g. Yelp to Google Contacts ⚠️
