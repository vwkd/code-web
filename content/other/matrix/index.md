# Matrix



## Introduction

- information synchronisation system on the Internet
- decentralised object database, eventually consistent
- like Git, but for real-time data
- beware: not a blockchain, database is not protected against lost or dropped messages, homeservers can differ if one lost messages the other didn't ❗️
- secure by default, E2E
- allows interoperable, decentralised, real-time IP communication
- liberates fragmented IP communication from vendor lock-in, e.g. WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, etc.
- like SMTP for email or PSTN for phone, but for any type of communication
