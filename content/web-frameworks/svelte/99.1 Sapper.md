# Sapper

<!-- todo: old from 25.10.2021, incorporate -->



### Svelte

By default SPAs, no routes, , just components with data flow
only with router library

By default CSR, i.e. source code of app is JS (either already JS, or compiled to JS) and then run on client by runtime, started through entry point (app.js, etc.)
But Svelte can also export SSR page with JS being used for hydration only


### Sapper

Svelte app is already SSR using compiler, but only single route. Sapper gives routes.

Only single template _layout.svelte, can't customise chain using multiple

preload function is what loads data for Client-Side rendering on Client-Side routing, should have been called route_data or something
-> Separate API from Sapper, only use Sapper as SSG not as middleware for API server
==> Separate Web server from API
If hosts own Web server and API can just use/modify data from static exported folder next to it
Sapper mixes code for backend API with client, not good
WHAT ABOUT DYNAMIC SSR? 

Script blocks can run on server or client, either on prerender or live on client (not two times for same route)
use this.fetch for browser compatible fetch method (wouldn't be necessary with Deno)
-> could have one "server" tag if only on server or one "client" tag if only on client or both if on both
server can't personalise, client can

 Script "module" always runs before normal
 Can use to fetch data ?!

Slugs are resolved on client side, queries API for data
beware: needs to rebuild static site for every new data entry, otherwise no server side route corresponding to client side generated route !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-> Needs to rebuild static site, either if resource at existing route changes, or if dynamically created route is added/removed because of modifications to underlying database behind HTTP API
ALREADY TODAY NOT HANDLED BY SVELTE, DOES STAIC EXPORT AT TIME OF EXPORT, RUNS SCRIPT BLOGS ON SERVER ONLY WHEN EXPORTING, DOESN'T UPDATE STATIC FILES, MAY GET OUT OF SYNC WITH DATABASE!!
Currently Sapper is designed as middleware, can server side render dynamically changing routes (slugs), static export would just be snapshot, would need to retrigger rebuild as soon as underlying data of slugged routes changes, difficult, needs to bridge time to rebuild, otherwise lands 404, could implement custom 404 handler that builds it same way that client would build it essentially what Sapper does now as middleware anyways OR could send runtime that does CS rendering and show 404 client side NO
Needs to only bridge time if initial page load, otherwise client does already CS routing himself to API

===> Basically wants Sapper to be Eleventy + Svelte compiler
What does Routify do??

Except that Eleventy doesn't support slugs because doesn't inject client side JS that could query server

<!-- ToDo: old incorporate into SvelteKit -->

## Introduction

- static site generator for client-side routed Svelte applications
beware: also allows server-side rendering of dynamic website as Express middleware
??? client-side routing via HTTP API only if Sapper is middleware ??


## Features

- contains Svelte compiler
- HTML template syntax ???

????
- markdown templates
- basic data flow, e.g. variables in frontmatter
- configurable routes
- set of pages, e.g. navigation, tags, etc.
- processing plugins, e.g. `<code>` syntax highlighting, etc.
- incremental build of only pages that changed
????

?? accessibility, e.g. history, focus on top of page, etc.

??? can export a static site, creates the .json files for the client-site rendered routes
??? but must make sure before exporting that each page is identical for any two distinct requests
because Sapper just follows all links and caches what documents it finds, if the current document is request-dependent, then cache is wrong

currently server-side rendered markup is replaced by client-side rendered one as soon as runtime loads ??? SOURCE YT VIDEO FROM RICH
    I.E. hydration is done badly

can't yet export only part of site and deliver other part dynamically, e.g. blog posts from HTTP API, home and contact statically

also no incremental compilation

?? PWA, service worker ?? just in template, nothing inherent to Sapper

## Routing

- filesystem-based
- each Svelte component in `src/routes` is a route

can exclude files by using leading underscore in file name

if has folder named `blog`, needs to put at `index.svelte` inside instead of outside as `blog.svelte` ???

dynamic routes using slugs ??!!?
slugs are ???
`[slug].svelte`
also preload method gets an argument with a `params` property that contains the slug name ?? in the slug property
i.e. `preload({ params }) { ... params.slug ... }`

beware: in slug compiler doesn't know what elements appear, eliminates unused CSS, needs to workaround using wrapper object and `:global(..)` modifier
```css
.wrapper :global(myselector) {

}
```

## Prefetching

enable with non-standard `rel=prefetch` attribute on a element ?? or hyperlink ??
?? how does it work

in component where link is pointing to, in a separate `module` script tag, export a `preload` function that fetches and returns data
uses `this.fetch()` ?? WHY
uses `this.error` in case of error
must return an object with a key that is named like the data, e.g. `{ post: ... }` ???

### Server routes

As well as pages (Svelte components, which render on server or client), you can create server routes in your routes directory.

These are just .js files that export functions corresponding to HTTP methods, and receive Express request and response objects as arguments.
This makes it very easy to, for example, add a JSON API such as the one powering this very page

needs to use Sapper as middleware ???


## QUESTIONS

- why use root as base for relative urls?
