# Web application

[TOC]



## Introduction

- dynamic website that behaves like a native application



## The problem

- Web apps are essentially hypertext documents overloaded with lots of CSS and JavaScript to make it behave dynamic
- but hypertext documents were designed to be static, represent documents, not applications
- building Web apps is a pain, since the foundation wasn't designed for it, behavior is designed to be strictly separate from structure and style but in real application the behavior is what dictates structure and style
- component frameworks help ease the pain, e.g. Svelte, but can't solve it since underlying foundation is wrong
- like drawing many static pictures and stitching them together to make them look like an animation film, today we use software to design the characters digitally without frames, frames are added when rendering



## The solution

- Web applications must be written as native applications, in native programming languages, not on top of hypertext document
- need to add links to native applications, since that's what's unique about Web apps
