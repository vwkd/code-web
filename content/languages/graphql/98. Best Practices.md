use JSON, enable gzip compression



## Rate limiting

per authenticated user, needs to quantify queries somehow, large queries are more costly than simple ones, e.g. amount of calls to database
would live in business logic layer

how to rate limit public API?



## Versioning

versionless API, no breaking changes, use new fields and arguments, deprecate old



## HTTP

API layer is behind Authentication layer, access to the session / user information

need to transmit query, variables as JSON, name of operation to execute

GET request: with query parameters `query`, `variables`, `operationName`

POST request:
    JSON with application/json content-type, with fields `query`, `operationName`, `variables`
    application/graphql content type, body in graphql query string ?? what about variables and operationName ?!

response: JSON, fields: "data": object with result, "errors": array with errors, omit if no errors



## Security

with power comes responsibility, client can now do arbitrary queries, good and bad

large queries
-> timeout, stop execution after timeout

circular queries, e.g. author -> posts -> author -> posts, etc.
-> Maximum Query Depth based on AST of query, doesn't even need to run it

Query Complexity
assign each field a number of its complexity, default 1, also depending on arguments
-> Maximum Complexity, doesn't even need to run it
but hard to do, how to quantify complexity, how to keep in sync with code, etc.

### rate limit

Based on Server Time,
    X time per Y interval
    or X time, where X is topped up every second by a little bit, 

Bucket Size: maximum server time for client
Leak Rate: gain of server time per second for client
TTC: time to complete the query
BS / TTC = maximum number of requests / sec that can make for the query, before needs to wait TTC / LR seconds until can make next request

Based on Query Complexity

## Todo

- analytics: field usage, performance of resolvers, etc.
- subscription, streaming
