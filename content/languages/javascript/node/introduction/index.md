## Modules

- a `.js` file
- can be imported in another `.js` file using `require()`
- can export values that are then imported, e.g. object, function, class, etc.
- can be package but doesn't need to



## Packages

- a `package.json` and a module that is referenced as `main` property in `package.json`, by default is called `index.js`
- packages are modules, but modules are not necessarily packages
- device-independent packages, need to be coded properly using built-in modules, e.g. `path.join()` instead of string cocatening file paths ❗️
