# The Weird Parts

<!-- TODO: move into introduction, then delete -->



- JS is famous for it's many bad design decisions

## (Value) Types

- set of intrinsic characteristics that we expect to be  able to do with that value, e.g. doing arithmatic
- values have types, not variables

- `typeof` returns string ??? undefined, string, number, bigint, boolean, object, symbol, function
- always returns one of those strings
- `typeof null` is "object`, historical bug, needs to use triple equals
- `typeof` doesn't distinguish arrays from objects, needs to use `Array.isArray()`
- `typeof` doesn't distinguish `NaN` from numbers, needs to use `a !== a`, or `Number.isNaN()`
- `typeof` returns `undefined` even for undeclared variable, bad design choice

undeclared != undefined != uninitialized

## Equals

- doesn't need triple equals if know there is no type coercion, e.g. with typeof operator
- triple equal lies for NaN and negative zero ❗️
- double equals calls triple equals if types match, i.e. `==` allows for coercion only _when the types are different_
- only `null` and `undefined` are coercively equal to each other and no other value, i.e. `a == null` or `a == undefined` only if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, are safe
- difference between `==` and `===` is coercion
- `==` prefers numeric comparison
- use double equal when you want to allow coercion, triple equals when you don't  
  don't just default to triple equals because you don't know your types, doesn't solve root of problem
- === lies with NaN and -0, Object.is() is like "====", better than "===", only way to check for -0, also works for NaN

### `NaN` ("Not a Number")

- invalid number, unlike its name suggest it is a number ❗️
- NaN "Not a number" is a number but an invalid number, e.g. `0 / 0`
- `typeof NaN` is "number"
- NaN is toxic, every operation with NaN results in NaN
- only value that is not equal to itself, i.e. can use `a !== a`, or `Number.isNaN()` to check for NaN
- don't use global `isNaN()` because does coercion, e.g. `isNaN("hello")` is `true`

### Negative Zero

- exists in IEEE745 ???
- useful to encode direction with number 
- JS tries to hide it, `toString()` returns `0`, is equal to zero, `Math.sign(+-0)` is `+-0` instead of `+-1`
- needs to use `Object.is()` or `1 / a === -Infinity`

### Primitive Types
### Abstract Operations
### Coercion

- implicit type conversion

- Primitive constructors coerce value to constructor type, e.g. `String(x)`, don't use to construct string objects ❗️ 
- if one knows his types then coercion is useful and not magic

`x++` first coerces to number, even though returns the same value and only then increments

`+` operator, if either is a string it will coerce both to strings and concatenate them
however `-` operator coerces always to number
unary `+` operator coerces to number first
comparison ops don't coerce to number if both are string, `<`, `>` ??
statements are false for all falsy values, including zero and empty string

truthy is not the same as coercively comparing to `true` ❗️

```javascript
const x = [];

if (x) {
  // true
}

if (x == true) {
  // false
}

if (x == false) {
  // false
}

// since [] is coerced to "" which is coerced to 0, and false is coerced to 0 as well
```

- never do `==` with `true` / `false` ❗️can just do truthy comparison, avoid the coercion corner cases
- avoid `==` with "" and 0, matches many corner cases
- avoid `==` with non-primitives, because coercion to primitives is problem ???
- don't use `==` with unknown types !!! so can deal with edge cases conciously
- if types are the same use `==` since is exactly the same as `===`
- if types are different use either one depending if wants coercion, 
- `==` is more concise, doesn't distract the reader with multiple `===`
- use `===` to signify to reader that you are uncertain about the types ❗️ best way to not need code comments explaining that you are uncertain about types  
  don't just blindly use `===` everywhere

- exact matches `Object.is()`, avoiding corner cases of `===` with NaN and -0

the two bottom values `undefined` and `null` behave almost the same, only in coercion to number needs to take care
