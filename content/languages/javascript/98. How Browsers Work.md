# Browser Internals


<!-- todo: finish -->
<!-- todo: move outside JavaScript -->


## Introduction

- how browser works under the hood
- relevant to fully understand behavior, e.g. Layout Trashing, JavaScript runtime, etc.
needs to understand how browsers work to get more performance, edge cases, etc.


## DOM

- browser's internal representation of the page
- DOM API is Web API to modify representation from JavaScript


## Example: Loading a page

//// rendering pipeline
Parse HTML
  builds DOM, very permissive, no error, tries to fix errors
  load subresources
Style Calculations
  parse CSS into Style Tree
  for each DOM node find the styles that apply to it, filter those that are overwritten, etc.
Layout
  compute boxes and their locations
Paint
  compute order

many optimizations, e.g. while parsing HTML look for subresources and load concurrently, etc.

rendering pipeline shares the main thread with JavaScript, JS might block it too long !!!
