# Configuration file

<!-- todo: finish, revise title -->



## Introduction

- API of a JavaScript program
- always validate user input
- can use `.json` if config is static data, otherwise `.js` because can compute data dynamically



## 1. Export data itself

```javascript
// config.js
export const api = {
    x: 1,
    y: 2,
}
```

- consumer provides data container (export)
- program can't limit data container to only accept certain properties, takes out only wanted properties later
- consumer can't set same property multiple times



## 2. Export function that returns data

```javascript
// config.js
export function api() {
    return {
        x: 1,
        y: 2,
    }
}
```

- like 1., but data is not computed at time of import but at time of function evaluation
- data can be computed multiple times by calling function again
- data can be compute asynchronously by making function async



## 3. Export argument on which data is set

- (not possible since can't provide an argument to a module, conceptually only for symmetry of 4. to 2.)
- program provides data container (argument)
- program can limit data container to only accept certain properties, e.g. using `Object.freeze()`, automatically throws if sets unknown property
- consumer can set same property multiple times
- consumer can pass multiple values to a property if it's a method
- consumer can read a property if implemented, e.g. getter, or `get*` method



## 4. Export function that accepts argument on which data is set

```javascript
// config.js
export function api(config) {

    // set through property / setter
    config.x = 1;

    // set through method
    config.setValue("y", 2);
}
```

- like 3., but data is not computed at time of import but at time of function evaluation
- data can be computed multiple times by calling function again
- data can be compute asynchronously by making function async
