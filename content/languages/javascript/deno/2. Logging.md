# Logging



## Introduction

- built-in standard library


initialises logger in own module, imports it into other modules

can specify logging level on handler, minimum logging level that it logs
can specify logging level on logger, minimum logging level that it imposes on all handlers
  can change during runtime

## Logger

object that logs



create logger with desired logging level
can set for different log levels, usually log higher levels as well i.e. everything more severe 

```js
const logger = winston.createLogger(...)

logger.info(..)
logger.warn(..)
```


## Logging handlers

add handlers

```js
if (Deno.env !== 'production') {
  logger.add(new winston.transports.Console());
}
```

???
- usually logs any level above as well

process logs, e.g. write to console, write to file, etc.


sets to warn in production, i.e. ignores granular logging
if error then ask user to put into debug mode
or if regularly uploads logs can also be finer


start logging with WARN+ for beginning, add rest over time where necessary
