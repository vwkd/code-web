# Introduction



## Deno

- JavaScript runtime, the better Node
- advantages:
  - Web compatible
    - identical Web APIs
    - ES modules using URLs instead of CommonJS using package manager
    - single global `Deno` object with any custom functionality
  - built-in async functions returns promises instead of taking callbacks
  - secure by default, scripts require permissions
  - runs TypeScript out-of-the-box
  - built-in tooling, e.g. format, lint, watch, upgrade, etc.



## Modules

- ES modules using URLs, like in browser
- can import and re-export external dependencies in a centralised file, avoids duplication of URLs, can use multiple files to separate production and development dependencies, e.g. `deps.ts` and `dev_deps.ts`, etc.
- dependencies are cached on first run
- cached in `DENO_DIR` folder, globally shared with other modules
  - Linux/Redox: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/deno` or `$HOME/.cache/deno`
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/deno` where `%LOCALAPPDATA% = FOLDERID_LocalAppData`
  - macOS: `$HOME/Library/Caches/deno`
  - Fallback: `$HOME/.deno`
- can guarantee subresource integrity using lock files with with `deno cache` (or `deno run`)
  - `--lock <FILE>`: uses lock file `<FILE>`
  - `--lock-write`: writes lock file, specify together with `--lock`
- beware: needs to opt-in to lock files instead of opt-out, always use lock files ⚠️
- beware: need to make sure that resource behind URL is immutable, e.g. link to specific commit / tag instead of `master` branch on GitHub ❗️
