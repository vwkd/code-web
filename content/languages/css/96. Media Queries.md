## Introduction

conditional rules, conditions can be viewport size, output medium, screen size??, screen resolution??, etc.
  device form factors, orientation, and available space
apply CSS if condition matches
should have been called "@if"

size MQs are relative to viewport

always use min-/max- instead of pure width, since otherwise applies only to this single value

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 800px) { 
    /* CC rules */
}
```

can use to create responsive wesites, e.g. single column on mobile, multiple columns on desktop

beware: design mobile first since largest user base, use media queries for desktop case, not other way around ❗️

condition is also called "breakpoint", since that's when layout changes

??? beware: don't use for layout since breakpoints are subjective, instead use responsive layouts, e.g. Flexbox Layout, Grid Layout, etc. ❗️
instead use for dark mode, etc.
