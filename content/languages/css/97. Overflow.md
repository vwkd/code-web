# Overflow

<!-- ToDo: finish -->



## Introduction

- overflow if document is larger than viewport
if content is larger than container
- user agent offers scrolling mechanism for overflow area
box with overflow can be scrolled, can scroll overflow into view
either horizontal or vertical scrolling
?!?! beware: any scrolling is always due to overflow ❗️

scrolling is block direction is natural, but not in inline direction, i.e. in horizontal writing mode vertical but not horizontal scrolling
prevent overflow in inline direction, e.g. no fixed inline size, flexible grid column size, etc.
allow overflow in block direction, e.g. fixed block size, fixed grid row size

???overflow-x controls line box width??? or containing block width???

- "horizontal" overflow applies to inline direction, "vertical" overflow applies to block direction
??? `overflow-y` is in block direction, `overflow-x` is in inline direction

scrollport: padding box of scroll container, can think of as viewport
  nearest scrollport is scrollport of nearest ancestor scroll container
!!!!! beware: padding box includes padding, e.g. stickily positioned elements is not affected by padding ❗️
!!!!! beware: scroll container doesn't need to have actualy overflow and be scrollable, just have `overflow` other than `visible` ❗️


beware: can think of text like inline-level boxes for each word, wrap around to next line in block direction, overflow easily in block end, but in inline end only where a word is longer than whole inline size and not hyphenated ❗️


- beware: content of non-replaced element can overflow, content of replaced element not because "part of element", e.g. images ❗️



<!-- beware: OLD, incorporate, then delete -->
- `overflow`: control behavior if content doesn’t fit in element’s box
- only applies to block elements with a specified size
- `visible` (default, not clipped), `hidden` (clipped and hidden), `scroll` (clipped, scroll bars), `auto` (clipped, scroll bars when needed)
- `overflow-x` / `-y`: the above just in horizontal / vertical direction
