# SVG



## SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

- XML-based markup language for describing two dimensional based vector graphics (as opposed to raster graphics)
- SVG is essentially to graphics what HTML is to text
- elements for shapes, e.g. circle, rect, polygon, text, etc.
- since is XML can be manipulated by CSS and JS ???
