## Introduction


## Client batching

batch multiple separate requests into one large to save bandwith
separate response again into smaller ones

## Client cache

should implement interface `Node` with `id` property that all other objects implement
    id is globally unique identifier
    for all object, even unrelated, used for caching
beware: identifier should be opaque, not leak implementation to userland, e.g. base64 encode

also `node` field on the query type that gets a node by id

```graphql
type Query {
    node(id: ID!): Node
    # ... more fields
}

interface Node {
    id: ID!
}
```

client can build cache of objects using id as identifier
load identical requests from cache
load partial requests from cache, send request only for missing fields, merge on client
    ?? what if data was mutated, then gets new data mixed with old...
    needs to invalidate cache when makes mutation
    ?? what if mutation doesn't happen due to client operation
    need to specify on client which fields are cacheable and which not

needs to normalize the data, nested result gets flattened
store contains only individual records that can be referenced with a globally unique ID
-> that's why schema should have root query field `node(id: ID!)` and `nodes`

## Server batching

batch database calls
