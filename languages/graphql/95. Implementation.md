query is traversed field by field, executing “resolvers” for each field
execution starts at the query type and goes breadth-first
result of resolver is passed into child resolver, until only reaches leaf fields
hierarchies are resolved synchronously in series, but lists are resolved concurrently

most engines provide “default resolvers”, don’t need to specify resolver for field when returned object of parent resolver has property with the childs field name

by default execution is naive, calls resolvers for every field without reusing same values
e.g. list of posts maybe all have same author, still calls author resolver for every field...
-> use batching, gathers fetches, discards any duplicates, then makes calls
https://github.com/graphql/dataloader
??? only works for same level (parallel)? not for subsequent levels ?? would need caching ?? e.g. single author writes all posts
```graphql
query {
  allPosts(first: 10) {
    name
    author {
      name
      posts(first: 10)
    }
  }
}
```


## Server frameworks

### graphql-js

GraphQL engine for Node.js

build a schema, doesn't use IDL, see ApolloServer
run queries against schema

Parsing the GraphQL language.
Building a GraphQL type schema.
Validating a GraphQL request against a type schema.
Executing a GraphQL request against a type schema.

parsing, validating, and executing a GraphQL document, with variables 

parses query
verifies query against schema
reports errors, can throw in resolvers

schema
resolvers
query validation, computation

resolver arguments are args, context, info
context is contextValue passed to init, or request object if none passed
beware: if defines schema programmatically, gets additional first argument source, also in apollo
validates that return type of resolver matches schema
beware: number is coerced to string!!!

root object with resolvers in properties, function that returns value or object, e.g. class instance
if no specific field resolver, just takes queried property of returned object
?? how to create more specific resolver on root object

consider constructing schema programmatically instead of using SDL, can implement resolvers together with it
no need to keep resolvers and schema in sync
can implement more complex types that don't map cleanly to object properties, e.g. union types, e.g. graphql-js, nexus, etc.


### graphql-express

parse query, variables, operation name from request body or URL parameters
call graphql-js

middleware for graphql-js
for express
includes GraphiQL

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { graphqlHTTP } from 'express-graphql';
import { buildSchema } from 'graphql';

// resolvers.js
const root = {
  hello: function (args, context, info) {
    return `Hello ${args.name}!`;
  },
};

// schema.js
const schema = buildSchema(`
  type Query {
    "A greeting to you."
    hello("Your name." name: String = "world"): String
  }
`);

// index.js
var app = express();
app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema: schema,
  rootValue: root,
  graphiql: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
}));
app.listen(4000);
console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql');
```

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { graphqlHTTP } from 'express-graphql';

import {
    GraphQLSchema,
    GraphQLObjectType,
    GraphQLString,
} from 'graphql';

// schema.js (includes resolvers since programmatic)
const query = new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'Query',
    fields: {
        hello: {
            type: GraphQLString,
            description: 'A greeting to you.',
            args: {
                name: {
                    description: "Your name.",
                    type: GraphQLString
                }
            },
            resolve(_source, args, context, info) {
                return `Hello ${args.name}!`;
            },
        },
    },
})

const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
    query
});

// index.js
var app = express();
app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
    schema: schema,
    graphiql: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
}));
app.listen(4000);
console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql');
```

### apolloserver

middleware for graphql-js
for express or other HTTP server frameworks

## Client frameworks

sending HTTP request with error handling
caching
batching

Apollo Client
Relay

## ?


for large APIs, generate schema from resolvers instead of keeping resolvers and schema in sync, e.g. Nexus

use library / framework, provides already spec compliance
    built-in types
    error messages
    parsing
    resolving

just provide schema and resolver functions

query fields are executed asynchronously in parallel while mutation fields synchronously in series, prevents race conditions ❗️


## Initialise

create context, pass it models

can pass in custom error formatting
can use to log error to logging framework

## Schema

doesn't map onto underlying database
has more fields, e.g. user, users, etc.

query-driven schema
Design your schema based on how data is used, not based on how it's stored

for mutating field return back object that mutated

## Resolvers


for each field function that computes its value
function that fetches data for a single field

- function that returns a value for field, may take arguments
concretely takes four arguments: previous ??, field arguments, context shared between all resolvers
- function name must equal field name
- return value must match type in schema
your job to make sure that return value makes sense, contains what it proclaims
- can be async

- can get data from whereever, e.g. microservices, etc.
- works well with TypeScript using same types as in schema

?? resolver of object type, vs. resolvers of specific fields of that object type (field specific resolvers)
?? default resolver

doesn't check if mutation actually has sideeffects, must make sure yourself

- beware: don't do authentication or authorisation in resolver, should not know about it, use layers before or after, see Auth

use error classes from framework
