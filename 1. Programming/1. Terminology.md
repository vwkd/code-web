- physical parts of a computer



## Software

- instructions for a computer
- often used as synonym for program



## Program

- set of instructions that make computer perform a particular task

- expression: unit of code that evaluates to a value, e.g. `1 + 2`
- evaluation: computation of an expression
- block: list of statements enclosed in `{}`



## Application Programming Interface (API)

- particular set of rules that two software programs can follow to interact with each other
- abstraction layer of underlying implementation



## (Software) Stack

- a hierarchical set of software that work together
- e.g. operating system, application (web server, database, etc.), programming language, etc.
- often named according to first letter of each member of set



## Compatibility

- backward compatibility: earlier specification works in future specification, e.g. HTML4 in environment for HTML5
- forward compatibility: future specification works in earlier specification, e.g. HTML5 in environment for HTML4
