# Programming Language



## Introduction

- language of code
- categorised by "level" of program
- beware: high-level and low-level are relative, changes with addiiton of higher levels, e.g. earlier C was considered high-level, nowawdays is considered low-level ❗️
- the higher the farther from processor instructions, more independent from system architecture, more natural



## Dynamic language

- has a runtime system



## Scripting language

- interpreted dynamic language
- usually interactive execution in a read–eval–print loop (REPL) possible
- e.g. Bash, JavaScript, etc.
