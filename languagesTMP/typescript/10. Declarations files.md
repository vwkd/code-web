## Declaration file

<!-- ToDo: Finish -->

- declaration files contain only type information
- named `*.d.ts`
- TS includes declaration files for built-in types and APIs in JS runtimes like browser and Node, e.g. DOM, BOM, Events, etc. pp.

- use `declare` to declare entity without knowing implementation



## Modules

- types in modules need to be imported / exported to be used in other files, like normal values
- types in non-modules are available in global scope to all files, don't need to be imported / exported, like normal values
- type-only imports and exports get removed on compilation
- (this convers only the standard ES6 modules!)

### Type-only exports

- use `export type` and module object, can also rename

```typescript
// foo.ts
export type { Person };

type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
};
```

- type-only exports have no default export ‚ùóÔ∏è
- beware: before TS 3.8, exported types like regular values, wasn't clear if exports should be erased on compilation, erasing meant modules with type-only exports couldn't be used for side effects, not erasing meant classes that were only used as types were compiled, with re-exports didn't even know if was type or value, etc. Always use type-only exports ‚ùóÔ∏è

```typescript
// foo.ts üëé
export type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
};

export default Person;
```

### Type-only imports

- use `import type` and destructuring of module object, can also rename

```typescript
// bar.ts
import type { Person } from "./foo";

const p: Person = {
    name: "Peter",
    age: 42
};
```

};
```
