# Generated content

## Introduction

 replaces an element with a generated value

- uses `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements ???

- acts as if it is a child node of the element it is generated on, for the purposes of positioning

- can set element `position: relative` and its pseudo-element with `position: absolute` relative to it

- The chunk of content is not added to the DOM, but can be styled like a DOM node, i.e. not visible to screen readers, not manipulatable using JavaScript etc.




insert content into your document using CSS.

The content property dictates what is rendered inside an element or pseudo-element.

For elements, it has only one purpose: specifying that the element renders as normal, or replacing the element with an image (and possibly some associated "alt text").

For pseudo-elements and margin boxes, it is more powerful. It controls whether the element renders at all, can replace the element with an image, or replace it with arbitrary inline content (text and images).

- don't use to add text
- can use to add visual indicators, e.g. icons
- may be inaccessible to screen readers
- hard to find and edit later
CSS-generated content is not included in the DOM. Because of this, it will not be represented in the accessibility tree and certain assistive technology/browser combinations will not announce it.

- can insert empty string and then style like empty element, e.g. make box, etc.
