# Tutorials Style Guide

[TOC]

<!-- ToDo: Enforce Style Guide on existing documents -->

## Content

- add Introduction section first to motivate the topic
- include a Resources section at last to list most important sources for previous content and where can learn more



## Style

- set 1 tab to 2 spaces, never use the tab character
- lists don't contain blank lines
- two break a new line within a list item, leave 2 spaces at end of list item and indent next line by 2 spaces
- put code boxes in top-level between two lists instead of in list item, only if code is in the middle of a second-level list don't outdent so second-level list doesn't break
- use sections with `##`, only first title is `#`
- use 3 blank lines between sections, only 1 blank line to separate any deeper hierarchy
- put 1 space between words, including unicode characters, e.g. Hello World ❗️
