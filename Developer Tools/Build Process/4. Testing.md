# Testing

[TOC]



## Introduction

- assert expected outcome of implementation on sample data
- warns from regression, changes break existing features, can confidently make changes
- integrate in release pipeline, address bugs immediately, e.g. on every commit
- needs set of sample data, as close to real data as possible
- beware: never rely only on tests, can not cover every possible path of execution ❗️



## Test cases

- test all critical use cases, edge cases, etc.
- test both desired and undesired use cases, i.e. expected results and expected errors ❗️
- test exact result, e.g. not only "contains" but "contains exactly"



## Testing levels

### Unit tests

- tests of underlying units of code, e.g. function, class, etc.
- usually written by developer together with code
- test single unit per test, don't mix multiple units together



## Other tests

### Performance tests
<!-- ToDo: Finish -->

- benchmarks ???
- warns if changes impact performance, can make changes confidently



## Test-driven development

- write unit tests first, then implementation
- forces developer to think about desired result first, focuses development on important things
- documents intentation
- tests implementation
