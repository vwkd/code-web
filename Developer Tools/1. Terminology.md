## Compiler

translates source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language, e.g. C to assembly



## Transpiler

- translates source code of one high-level programming language into another high-level programming language, e.g. CoffeeScript / Dart / TypeScript to JavaScript
- target programming languages may be the same as source, e.g. JavaScript to JavaScript
Babel
- used to write in desired language and compile back to undesired, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, or ES6+ to ES5



## (Module) Bundler

- compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application, not needed anymore with ES modules?
rollup, webpack



## Build tool

- converts source files to distributable files, e.g. transpiling, minifying, concatenating, etc.
Snowpack



## Task runner

- run any possible task, not only building, e.g. linting, running tests, deploying, etc.
gulp.js
browser-sync


<!-- todo: old -->
## Build process

process to convert developer files into servable files ??

write in TypeScript
set up dev and build scripts
linting, minifying, compression, sourcemaps
compile everything, e.g. using task runner
