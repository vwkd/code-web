## Introduction

- "Whenever there is a divergence between what your brain thinks is happening and what is actually happening in the computer, that's where bugs enter the code." - Kyle Simpson

## Code style

- "Don't be clever just to save a couple of characters. Be more explicit about it in the places where explicitness is more communicative.` - Kyle Simpson
- use comments to explain the _why_ not the _what_, sometimes the _how_ if it's too confusing, because can see _what_ is done but doesn't know _why_ it's done
