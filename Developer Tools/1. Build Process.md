## Introduction

- compiler: translates source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language, e.g. C to assembly
- transpiler: translates source code of one high-level programming language into another high-level programming language, e.g. CoffeeScript, Dart and TypeScript are transpiled to JavaScript
  - target programming languages may be the same as source, e.g. JavaScript to JavaScript
  - used to write in desired language and compile back to undesired, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, or ES6+ to ES5
- module bundler:  compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application
- build tool: converts source files to distributable files, e.g. transpiling, minifying, concatenating, etc.
- task runner: run any possible task, not only building, e.g. linting, running tests, deploying, etc.



## Build process

<!-- ToDo: Finish -->

- write in TypeScript
- set up dev and build scripts
- linting, minifying, compression, sourcemaps
- compile everything, e.g. using task runner
